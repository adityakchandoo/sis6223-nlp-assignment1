               social services,

               parties, impartiality and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the

S/RES/2640 (2022)

                     Welcoming the efforts of neighbouring countries as well as of regional actors
               particularly the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the
               African Union (AU) to enhance their support to ensure Malian stakeholders build the
               foundations for a more stable and peaceful country,
                     Strongly condemning the continued attacks against civilians, representatives

               Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), the French forces and the European
               Union Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali), paying tribute to the bravery and
               sacrifices made by the soldiers engaged in Mali and the Sahel, especially to those who
               lost their lives,
                     Acknowledging the central role of the MDSF in the fight against terrorism in
               Mali, taking note of the intensification of counter terrorist operations by the MDSF
               in Central Mali, and calling for the full respect of international human rights law and
               international humanitarian law in these operations,
                     Underlining that lasting peace and security in the Sahel region will not be
               achieved without a combination of political, security, peacebuilding and sustainable
               development efforts benefitting all regions of Mali, as well as the full, effective and
               inclusive implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali
               emanating from the Algiers process (“the Agreement”), and ensures full, equal and
               meaningful participation of women and youth, and welcoming in this regard the
               increased representation of women in the Comité de suivi de l’Accord (CSA),
                     Expressing its appreciation for the contribution of the French forces to the
               stabilization of Mali and noting also the contribution of the Takuba Task Force,
               welcoming the steps taken in advancing the “Coalition for the Sahel”, aimed at
               fighting against terrorism, strengthening the Sahelian States’ military capabilities,
               supporting the restoration of State authority throughout the territory, and bolstering
               development assistance, the Partnership for Security and Stab ility in the Sahel and
               the Sahel Alliance,
                     Taking note of the Transition Government of Mali’s decision to extend the
               transition period by 24 months starting on 26 March 2022, following the
               non-achievement of the agreed 18-month transition timeline, noting some work done
               to foster dialogue and lay the foundations for reforms, reiterating its support to the
               mediation efforts by ECOWAS and its mediator, and encouraging engagement in good
               faith negotiations, ahead of the ECOWAS Summit scheduled for 3 July 2022 , in order
               to reach agreement on credible and acceptable timelines for the holding of inclusive,
               free, fair and transparent elections and the swift return to constitutional order,
                     Reiterating that the UN and other international partners remain firmly
               committed to the implementation of the Agreement as a means to achieve long -term
               peace and stability in Mali, acknowledging the efforts of the head and members of the
               CSA to enhance the implementation of the Agreement, expressing concern that the
               lack of engagement by the Transition Government of Mali and the Plateforme and
               Coordination armed groups (“the Malian parties”) has prevented the CSA meeting
               since October 2021, expressing a significant impatience with parties over the
               persistent delays in the implementation of the Agreement, which contribute to a
               political and security vacuum jeopardizing the stability and development of Mali,
               stressing the need for increased ownership and prioritization in the implementation
               of the Agreement, and reiterating that engaging in hostilities in violation of the
               Agreement as well as actions taken that obstruct, or that obstruct by prolonged delay,
               or that threaten the implementation of the Agreement constitute a basis for sanctions
               designations pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017), among other designation criteria,

2/17                                                                                                     22-10294

                 Stressing that stabilization of the situation in Central Mali requires the Malian
           authorities and relevant stakeholders to agree on and effectively implement a
           comprehensive politically led strategy, and to pursue simultaneous and coordinated
           action on security, governance, sustainable development, reconciliation,
           accountability, as well as protection and promotion of human rights,

           to comply with their obligations under applicable international law,
                 Reiterating, in this regard, the importance of holding accountable all those
           responsible for such acts and that some of such acts referred to in the paragraph above
           may amount to crimes under the Rome Statute, taking note that, acting upon the referral
           of the transitional authorities of Mali dated 13 July 2012, the Prosecutor of the
           International Criminal Court (ICC) opened on 16 January 2013 an investigation into
           alleged crimes committed on the territory of Mali since January 2012, and further taking
           note of the finalization of the work of the International Commission of Inquiry established
           in accordance with the Agreement and as requested by resolution 2364 (2017),

           peace in Mali through sustainable economic development including infrastructure
           development, industrialization, poverty eradication, job creation, agricultural

           enhance good economic governance through the reinforcement of fiscal and financial
           management institutions in support of effective revenue collection, monitoring and
           evaluation mechanisms and anti-corruption structures to ensure accountability and
           transparency, recalling the necessity to enhance the implementation of the United
           Nations Integrated Strategy for the Sahel (UNISS) and the United Nations Support
           Plan for the Sahel, and welcoming the Peacebuilding fund’s increased focus on crossborder projects in the Sahel,
                 Emphasizing the need for adequate risk assessment and risk management
           strategies, by the Transition Government of Mali and the United Nations, of
           ecological changes, natural disasters, drought, desertification, land degradation, foo d
           insecurity, energy access, climate change, among other factors, on the security and
           stability of Mali,
                  Commending troop- and police-contributing countries of MINUSMA for their
           contribution, paying tribute to the peacekeepers who risk, as well as those who have
           lost, their lives in this respect,
                Expressing concern that some of MINUSMA’s mandated tasks have been
           obstructed, including through restrictions on freedom of movement, constraints on
           mission operations and violations of the Status of Forces Agree ment (SOFA) which
           may also present a risk to the security and safety of peacekeepers,
                 Expressing concern over reports of some training and capabilities shortfalls of
           MINUSMA units, undeclared caveats, non-compliance with orders, and emphasizing
           the importance of transparency and accountability of the mission’s performance,
