                    Recalling all of its previous resolutions, statements of its President, and press
               statements on the situation in the Central African Republic (CAR),

               territorial integrity of the CAR, and recalling the importance of the principles of
               non-interference, good-neighbourliness and regional cooperation,
                     Reaffirming the basic principles of peacekeeping, such as consent of the parties,
               impartiality, and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the mandate,
               recognising that the mandate of each peacekeeping mission is specific to the need and
               situation of the country concerned, underlining that the mandates that it authorises
               are consistent with the basic principles, reiterating that the Security Council expects
               full delivery of the mandates it authorises, and recalling in this regard its resolution
               2436 (2018),
                     Recalling that the CAR authorities have the primary responsibility to protect all
               populations in the CAR, including from international crimes, recognising the
               persistent security challenge threatening civilians, also underlining the progress made
               to restore State authority in all parts of the country, including MINUSCA’s assistance,
               to overcome the threats posed by armed groups,
                    Emphasising that any sustainable solution to the crisis in the CAR should be
               CAR-owned, including the political process, and should prioritise reconciliation of
               the Central African people, through an inclusive process that involves men and
               women of all social, economic, political, religious and ethnic backgrounds, including
               those displaced by the crisis,

               the framework of the African Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation in the CAR and
               under the auspices of the African Union (AU), stressing its centrality and the need for
               further progress in its implementation, and reaffirming that implementation of the
               APPR remains the only mechanism for achieving lasting peace and stability in the
               CAR and the only framework for dialogue with armed groups that have renounced
               violence, welcoming the dissolution, disarmament and demobilization of six armed
               groups and of the wings of two other armed groups out of fourteen signatories of the

                    Condemning in the strongest terms violations of the APPR and violence
               perpetrated by all parties to the conflict, particularly armed groups, throughout the
               country, including through the increased use of explosive ordnance, violence aiming
               at obstructing the electoral process, incitement to violence and hatred targeting
               specifically persons belonging to certain ethnic and religious communities resulting
               in deaths, injuries and displacements, violations of international humanitarian law
               and human rights violations and abuses, including those committed against children
               and those involving conflict-related sexual violence,
                    Underlining that ongoing violence by armed groups operating in the CAR
               continues to pose a threat to the security situation and political stability in the country,

               strong political commitment from the CAR authorities and regional countries, also

               exploitation and trade of natural resources, as well as attempts to unconstitutionally

               the CAR to respect the ceasefire announced on 15 October 2021, expre ssing concern
               that some armed groups signatories to the APPR continue to disregard their
               commitments and underscoring the need for neighbouring states, regional
               organisations and all international partners to support the implementation of the
               APPR via the roadmap and to continue coordinating their actions with the CAR
               Government to bring lasting peace and stability to the CAR,

                 40. Reiterates its concern at the continuing lack of key capabilities for
           MINUSCA and the need to fill gaps, as well as the importance of current and future
           troop and police contributing countries (T/PCCs) providing troop s and police with
           adequate capabilities, equipment and predeployment training, including with regards
           to engineering capabilities and explosive ordnance threat mitigation, in order to
           enhance the mobility capacity of MINUSCA and its ability to operate effe ctively in
           an increasingly complex security environment;
                 41. Recognises that the effective implementation of peacekeeping mandates is
           the responsibility of all stakeholders and is contingent upon several critical factors,
           including well-defined, realistic, and achievable mandates, political will, leadership,
           strategic communications, performance and accountability at all levels, integration
           across components, adequate resources, policy, planning, and operational guidelines,
           and training and equipment, urges Member States to provide troops and police that

           countries to implement relevant provisions of resolution 2538 (2020) notes the
           potential adverse effects on mandate implementation of national caveats which have
           not been declared and accepted by the Secretary-General prior to deployment,
           highlights that lack of effective command and control, refusal to obey orders, failure
           to respond to attacks on civilians, declining to particip ate in or undertake patrols may
           adversely affect the shared responsibility for effective mandate implementation, and
           calls on Members State to declare all national caveats, prior to the contingent
           deployment, provide troops and police with the minimum of d eclared caveats, and to
           fully and effectively implement the provisions of the Memoranda of Understanding
           (MoU) signed with the United Nations;
                 42. Requests the Secretary-General, Member States, and the CAR authorities

           throughout the CAR, in line with resolution 2518 (2020), including by authorising
           night flights, notes with concern the grave risks violations of the Status of Force
           Agreement can present to the safety and security of United Nations personnel serving
           in peacekeeping operations, and requests the Secretary-General to implement the
           provisions of resolution 2589 (2021) for establishing accountability for crimes against
           peacekeepers;
                  43. Requests the Secretary-General to fully implement the capacities and
           existing obligations mentioned in paragraph 43 of resolution 2659 (2022) in the
