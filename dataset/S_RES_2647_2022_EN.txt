                     Recalling that Libya’s oil resources are for the benefit of all Libyans and need
               to remain under the exclusive control of the National Oil Corporation, calling on all
               parties to allow the National Oil Corporation to undertake its work without disruption
               interference, or politicisation, and recalling the importance of Libyan oversight over

               including arbitrary detention, ill treatment, their exposure to sexual and gend er-based
               violence, and the inability of IDPs to return to their homes due to the presence of
