               women from working for the United Nations in Afghanistan, in addition to the earlier
               restrictions that banned Afghan women from working for international and national
               non-governmental organizations, will negatively and severely i mpact United Nations
               operations in the country, including the delivery of life-saving assistance and basic
               services to the most vulnerable, and the ability of the United Nations Assistance

               challenges facing Afghanistan’s economy, including through efforts to restore the

               assistance and other activities that support basic human needs in Afghan istan,
                    1.   Condemns the decision by the Taliban to ban Afghan women from working

               population and economic and social conditions that can lead to self -reliance and
               stability in Afghanistan, and recognizes the need to help address the substantial
