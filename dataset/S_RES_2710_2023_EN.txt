               made in Somalia,
                     Expressing grave concern that Al-Shabaab continues to pose a serious threat to

               neighbouring states, expressing deep concern at the loss of life from these attacks and
               the risk to international forces, reiterating its determination to support comprehensive
               efforts to reduce the threat posed by Al-Shabaab, and recalling that any measures
               taken to counter terrorism must comply with all obligations under international law,
                    Noting that the Somali Security Forces (SSF) and the African Union Transition
               Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) have achieved operational successes against

               Somalia and East Africa,
                  Acknowledging the effective completion of the Phase 1 drawdown of 2,000

               ATMIS personnel, until 31 December 2023, in response to Somalia’s request,
                    Recalling that the Joint Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General on 7 March
               2022 and paragraph 28 of resolution 2628 (2022) envisages further reductions to
               10,626 uniformed personnel, inclusive of a minimum number of 1 ,040 police
