                      Underscoring the importance of a holistic and gender sensitive approach to
                counter terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism, conducted in

                nationality, civilisation or ethnic group, condemning terrorist groups’ attempts to craft
                distorted narratives that are based on the misinterpretation and mis representation of
                religion to justify violence and to popularise their attempts to undermine Somalia and
                the region, expressing concern over their exploitation of information and

                urging continued development of a Somalia-led, coordinated approach in developing
                Somalia’s maritime governance sector, including through the formation of the Somali

                institutions,
                      Expressing serious concern about the humanitarian situation in Somalia,
                encouraging States to scale-up their humanitarian support to Somalia, and calling for

                provisions of international law, including applicable international humanitarian law,
                and in a manner consistent with the United Nations guiding principles of humanitarian
                emergency assistance (United Nations General Assembly resolution 46/182),
                including humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independen ce, the rapid and
                unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance necessary to support persons in need
                across Somalia and recalling that the Committee established pursuant to resolution
                751 (1992) may designate individuals or entities that engage in obstruction of the
                delivery of humanitarian assistance to Somalia, or access to, or distribution of,
                humanitarian assistance in Somalia,

                are humanitarian personnel, and civilian objects in situations of conflict, as well as
                the indiscriminate use of weapons in populated areas and their consequences for the
                civilian population, calling upon all parties to the conflict in Somalia to refrain from
                such practices in accordance with their obligations under international law, including
                international humanitarian law,
                     Expressing concern at the continued reports of corruption and diversion of
                public resources in Somalia, and calling for the Somali Government authorities to
                continue efforts to address corruption, strengthen administrative management,
                improve financial transparency, make good use of public resources and continue to
                accelerate the pace of reform,

           authorities to further strengthen efforts to address the “six grave violations” against
