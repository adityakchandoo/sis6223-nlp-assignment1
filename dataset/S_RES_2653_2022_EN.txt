               Adopted by the Security Council at its 9159th meeting, on
               21 October 2022

                    The Security Council,
                     Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial
               integrity and unity of Haiti,
                    Recalling all its previous resolutions on Haiti, in particular its resolution 2645
               (2022), which inter alia extended the mandate of the United Nations Integrated Office
               in Haiti (BINUH) for one year, demanded an immediate cessation of gang violence
               and criminal activity, and expressed the Council’s readiness to take appropriate
               measures, as necessary, against those engaged in or supporting gang violence,
               criminal activities or human rights abuses, or who otherwise take action that
               undermines the peace, stability, and security of Haiti and the region,

               to support the people of Haiti,

               in the situation concerning Haiti,
                    Stressing the primary responsibility of the Government of Haiti to address
               longstanding drivers of instability and inequality,
                     Reiterating the need to reach an urgent agreement on a sustainable, time-bound
               and commonly accepted framework for a political process led by Haitians to permit the
               organization of inclusive, free and fair legislative and presidential elections, carried out
               in a transparent manner, as soon as security conditions and logistical preparations
               permit, and with the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and the
               engagement of youth, civil society, and other relevant stakeholders, and recalling its
               request to the Government of Haiti to provide an update on the political process,
                     Expressing grave concern about the extremely high levels of gang violence and
               other criminal activities, including kidnappings, trafficking in persons and the
               smuggling of migrants, and homicides, and sexual and gender-based violence
               including rape and sexual slavery, as well as ongoing impunity for perpetrators,
               corruption and recruitment of children by gangs and the implications of Haiti’s
               situation for the region,
                     Concerned that illicit trafficking and diversion of arms an d related materiel of
               all types contributes to undermining the rule of law and respect for human rights, and

               can impede the provision of humanitarian assistance and have wide ranging negative
               humanitarian and socioeconomic consequences,
                     Noting the need to prohibit the transfer of small arms, light weapons, and
               ammunition to non-state actors engaged in or supporting gang violence, criminal
               activities, or human rights abuses in Haiti, as well as to prevent their illicit trafficking
               and diversion,
                     Encouraging cooperation between Member States to prevent illicit arms
               trafficking and diversion, including through providing and exchanging timely and up
               to date information in order to identify and combat illicit trafficking sources and
               supply chains,
                    Acknowledging the urgent need to address the illicit financial flows to Haiti
               enabling armed gangs to operate and posing a growing threat to the country’s stability,
               including by prioritizing breaking links between political and economic actors and
               gangs,
                     Expressing concerns about the Haitian National Police’s lack of access to vital
               ports which are largely under the control of gangs, and further demanding to stop the
               illegal occupation of ports and fuel terminals by gangs,
                     Welcoming the launch of technical programmes by the United Nations Office on
               Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to assist national authorities to promote border and ports
               control, trace illicit financial flows, collaborate across borders to combat
               transnational crime, corruption, and drug and arms trafficking, including through the
               UNODC-World Customs Organization (WCO) Container Control Programme in Haiti
               and border management programmes, and further welcoming the Caribbean
               Community’s (CARICOM) regional roadmap to combat the trafficking of firearms ,
                    Recognizing the important role of neighboring countries, regional and
               subregional organizations such as CARICOM, and other international partners,
                    Expressing deep concern at the persistent and destabilizing criminal activities

               weapons, and ammunition to actors engaged in or supporting gang violence,
                     Condemning attacks and kidnappings of UN personnel, violence against

               primary responsibility for the safety and security of United Nations personnel and
               assets rests with the host state,
                     Calling upon all actors in Haiti to issue clear orders prohibiting all human rights
               violations and abuses, and underscoring the necessity for all actors to ensure
               immediate, safe and unhindered access by humanitarian organizations,
                    Stressing that the measures imposed by this resolution are not intended to have
               adverse humanitarian consequences for the civilian po pulation of Haiti,

               delisting requests,

               international peace and security in the region,

           established in paragraph 21 of this resolution (the “Panel of Experts”) report to the

Annex
           Jimmy Cherizier (AKA “Barbeque”) has engaged in acts that threaten the peace,
           security, and stability of Haiti and has planned, directed, or committed acts that
           constitute serious human rights abuses.
           Jimmy Cherizier is one of Haiti’s most influential gang leaders and leads an alliance
           of Haitian gangs known as the “G9 Family and Allies.”
           While serving as an officer in the Haitian National Police (HNP), Cherizier planned
           and participated in the November 2018 deadly attack against civilians in a Port -au-Prince neighborhood known as La Saline. During this attack, at least 71 people were
           killed, over 400 houses were destroyed, and at least seven women were raped by
           armed gangs. Throughout 2018 and 2019, Cherizier led armed groups in coordinated,
           brutal attacks in Port-au-Prince neighborhoods. In May 2020, Cherizier led armed
           gangs in a five-day attack in multiple Port-au-Prince neighborhoods in which civilians
           were killed and houses were set on fire. As of October 11, 2022, Cherizier and his G9
           gang confederation are actively blocking the free movement of fuel from the Varreux
           fuel terminal – the largest in Haiti. His actions have directly contributed to the
           economic paralysis and humanitarian crisis in Haiti.
