                     Recalling the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and

                     Condemning in the strongest terms the killing of, and all acts of violence against
               United Nations personnel serving in peacekeeping operations, including, but not
               limited to, their detention and abduction, and recalling that such acts against
               peacekeepers may constitute war crimes,
                    Paying tribute to all United Nations personnel serving in peacekeeping
               operations, including those who have sacrificed their lives in the line of duty for the
               cause of peace,
                     Underscoring the importance of peacekeeping as one of the most effective tools
               available to the United Nations in the promotion and maintenance of international
               peace and security, reaffirming that lasting peace is neither achieved nor sustained by
               military and technical engagements alone, but through political solutions and strongly
               convinced that this should guide the design and deployment of United Nations peace
               operations, and understanding United Nations peace operations as peacekeeping
               operations and special political missions,
                    Expressing particular concern for the comprehensive wellbeing of United
               Nations peace operations personnel who face a wide range of challenges and operate
               in complex environments,
                    Noting that United Nations personnel serving in peacekeeping operations are
               deployed in deteriorating and complex political and security environments, and
               expressing grave concern about the security threats and targeted attacks against
               United Nations personnel serving in peacekeeping operations, which constitute a
               major challenge to United Nations operations,
                     Expressing deep appreciation for all UN personnel in UN peace operations for
               their extraordinary efforts in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and its
               consequences,
                   Recognizing the negative impact that misinformation and disinformation
               campaigns against the United Nations can have on the safety and security of peace
