           reaction forces, and sequenced through a phased approach, and recalls the importan ce
           of cooperation between MINUSCA and the CAR authorities in line with its mandat e;
                 40. Reiterates its concern at the continuing lack of key capabilities fo r
           MINUSCA and the need to fill gaps, as well as the importance of current and futu re

           adequate capabilities, equipment and predeployment training, including with regard s
           to engineering capabilities and explosive ordnance threat mitigation, in order to

           countries to implement relevant provisions of resolution 2538 (2020) notes the
           potential adverse effects on mandate implementation of national caveats which hav e
           not been declared and accepted by the Secretary -Gen eral prior to deploymen t ,
           highlights that lack of effective command and control, refusal to obey orders, failu re
           to respond to attacks on civilians, declining to participate in or undertake patrols may
           adversely affect the shared responsibility for effective mandate implementation, and
           calls on Members State to declare all national caveats, prior to the contingen t
           deployment, provide troops and police with the minimum of declared caveats, and to

           in peacekeeping operations, and requests the Secretary-General to implement the
           provisions of resolution 2589 (2021) for establishing accountability for crimes against
