               Ex-Kasai Occidental and of efforts towards ensuring accountability, reiterating the
               need for the Government of the DRC to fully investigate the killing of the two
               members of the Group of Experts and the four Congolese nationals accompanyin g
               them and bring those responsible to justice, welcoming the work of the United Nations

               authorities in their investigations, in agreement with the Congolese authorities, and
