                                                                                 29 October 2021




               Resolution 2603 (2021)
               Adopted by the Security Council at its 8891st meeting, on
               29 October 2021

                    The Security Council,
                   Reaffirming its full commitment to the peace process in the Republic of
               Colombia,
                    Recalling all its resolutions and statements of its President regarding the peace
               process in Colombia,
                     Welcoming the progress made towards peace across Colombia since the adoption
               of the Final Agreement for Ending the Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting
               Peace (the Final Agreement), noting the upcoming fifth anniversary of its signing,
               and urging the parties, with the support of relevant state institutions and security
               forces, as well as civil society, to work together to build upon this progress and
               address ongoing challenges, in particular the continued violence in conflict -affected
               areas, through comprehensive implementation of the Final Agreement, including rural
               reform, inclusive political participation, its ethnic and gender provisions, and
               countering illicit drugs including through crop substitution programmes,
                     Recalling in particular its resolution 2366 (2017) which established the United
               Nations Verification Mission in Colombia (the Verification Mission) to verify
               implementation by the Government of Colombia and Revolutionary Armed Forces of
               Colombia (FARC-EP) of sections 3.2 and 3.4 of the Final Agreement as called f or in
               section 6.3.3 of the Final Agreement, and recalling the positive role played by the
               Verification Mission in that regard,
                     Recalling also its resolution 2574 (2021) which expanded the mandate of the
               Verification Mission to include the additional task of verifying compliance with and
               implementation of the sentences to be issued by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace
               (SJP), and welcoming the preparations being made by the Verification Mission,
               working with the SJP, in this regard,
                     Noting that, under the terms of the Final Agreement, the sentences of the SJP
               will have the overall aim of realising the rights of victims and consolidating peace,
               and will need to have the greatest restorative and reparative function in relation to the
               harm caused,
                    Recognising the contribution the Verification Mission could make to building
               confidence in the Comprehensive System for Truth, Justice, Reparation and
               Non-Repetition established under the Final Agreement, which is integral to the

               further extension of the mandate of the Verification Mission on the basis of agreement
               between the parties.
