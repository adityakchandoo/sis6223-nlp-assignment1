               United Nations                                                                  S/RES/2289 (2016)
               Security Council                                              Distr.: General
                                                                             27 May 2016




               Resolution 2289 (2016)
               Adopted by the Security Council at its 7700th meeting,
               on 27 May 2016

                    The Security Council,
                    Recalling all its previous resolutions and statements of its President
               concerning the situation in Somalia, in particular resolutions 2093 (2013), 2232
               (2015) and 2245 (2015),
                    Recognizing the importance of consultation with the relevant stakeholders
               during the recent Security Council mission to Somalia,
                    Noting the need to allow adequate time for consideration of the outcomes of
               the mission, and in this regard, recognizing the need for a short extension of the
               mandate of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM ),
                     Determining that the situation in Somalia continues to constitute a threat to
               international peace and security in the region,
                    Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,
                     1.    Decides to authorize the Member States of the African Union to maintain
               the deployment of AMISOM, as set out in paragraph 1 of resolution 2093 (2013)
               until 8 July 2016, in line with the Security Councilâ€™s request to the African Union
               for a maximum level of 22,126 uniformed personnel, and authorizes Member States
               participating in AMISOM to take all necessary measures to carry out its mandate as
               set out in paragraph 3 of resolution 2232 (2015);
                     2.   Requests the Secretary-General to continue to provide logistical support
               in accordance with paragraph 2 of resolution 2245 (2015);
                    3.   Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
