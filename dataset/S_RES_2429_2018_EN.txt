               Resolution 2429 (2018)
               Adopted by the Security Council at its 8311th meeting, on
               13 July 2018

                    The Security Council,
                     Reaffirming all its previous resolutions and presidential statements concerning
               the situation in Sudan and underlining the importance of full compliance with these,
                      Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity, independence and
               territorial integrity of Sudan and its determination to work with the Government of
               Sudan, in full respect of its sovereignty, to assist in tackling the various challenges in
               Sudan,
                     Recalling the importance of the principles of the peaceful settlement of
               international disputes, good neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in the
               relations among States in the region,
                     Reaffirming the basic principles of peacekeeping, including consent of the
               parties, impartiality and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the
               mandate, and recognising that the mandate of each peacekeeping mission is specific
               to the country concerned, and recalling S/PRST/2015/22,
                    Recalling all its relevant resolutions on women, peace and security, on children
               and armed conflicts, on the protection of humanitarian and United Nations personnel,
               and on the protection of civilians in armed conflicts,
                    Underlining, without prejudice to the Security Council’s primary responsibility
               for the maintenance of international peace and security, the importance of the
               partnership between the United Nations and the African Union, consistent with
               Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, with regard to the maintenance of
               peace and security in Africa, particularly in Sudan,
                   Noting the African Union Peace and Security Council communique
               PSC/PR/COMM.(DCCLXXVIII) on the renewal of the mandate of the African
               Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID),
                     Recalling resolution 2378 (2017), which requests the Secretary-General to
               ensure that data related to the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations, inc luding
               peacekeeping performance data, is used to improve analytics and evaluation of
               mission operations, based on clear and well identified benchmarks, and further
               recalling resolution 2242 (2015) and its aspiration to double the number of women in

S/RES/2429 (2018)

               Current situation
                     Welcoming the improvement in security conditions while expressing concern
               that the security situation in Darfur remains precarious due to the destabilising
               activities of a number of actors, including elements of some armed movements,
               auxiliary units of the Government of Sudan forces and militia groups, and which
               further exacerbate insecurity, threats against civilians in Darfur, inter-communal
               violence, acts of criminality, and the lack of development and rule of law,
                    Welcoming the reduction of military confrontations between Government forces
               and rebel groups, noting the announcement of unilateral cessations of hostilities by
               the Government of Sudan and by the Sudan Liberation Army/Minni Minnawi
               (SLA/MM), the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM)/Gibril and the Sudan
               Liberation Movement-Transitional Council (SLM-TC),
                     Expressing concern at ongoing clashes in Jebel Marra, which have resulted in
               burning down of villages, new civilian displacement, and restricted humanitarian
               access, condemning any violations of unilateral cessations of hostilities and urging
               all parties to abide by their unilateral cessations of ho stilities, where they exist, and
               to immediately agree to a permanent ceasefire,
                     Recalling its resolution 2117 (2013) and expressing concern at the threat to
               peace and security in Darfur arising from the illicit transfer, destabilising
               accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, and the continued threats
               to civilians posed by unexploded ordnance, recognising the role of the Sudan-Chad
               Joint Border Force and the weapons-collection programme launched by the
               Government in this regard, and noting that the programme has contributed to the
               reduction in inter-communal violence and criminality,
                    Reiterating its demand that all parties to the conflict in Darfur immediately end
               violence, including attacks on civilians, peacekeepers and humanitarian personnel,
                     Noting that, notwithstanding the significant decrease in inter-communal
               conflicts, they remain one of the main sources of violence in Darfur and expressing
               concern at ongoing inter-communal conflicts over land, access to water and other
               resources, migration issues and tribal rivalries, including with the involvement of
               paramilitary units and tribal militias, as well as at the persistence of attacks against
               civilians, sexual and gender-based violence and grave violations against children, and
               that crucial grievances that caused the conflict remain unaddressed,
                      Welcoming efforts by the Government of Sudan, including local authorities, to
               restore law and order through the deployment across Darfur of add itional human and
               material resources for policing, corrections and judiciary, noting that rule of law
               capacity remains limited, urging the Government of Sudan to consolidate and expand
               its efforts to end impunity and to enhance the protective environment f or the civilian
               population, without any discrimination, particularly with respect to violations and
               abuses of women’s rights and sexual and gender-based violence as well as grave
               violations and abuses against children, and acknowledging the important role
               UNAMID has played in strengthening rule of law institutions, and noting requests
               from state and local officials for increased rule-of-law capacity building assistance
               from the UN Country Team and UNAMID, particularly to benefit the Sudanese police
               and judicial and corrections institutions, to establish a protective environmen t,
                    Emphasising that those responsible for violations of international humanitarian
               law and violations and abuses of human rights must be held accountable and that the
               Government of Sudan bears the primary responsibility to protect civilians, including
               women and children, within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction, including
               protection from crimes against humanity and war crimes,


2/15                                                                                                        18-11690

                                                                                                 S/RES/2429 (2018)

           Humanitarian situation and displacement and development issues
                 Welcoming significant reductions in the number of internally displaced persons
           (IDPs), while expressing concern that a very significant number, approximately two
           million people, remain long term displaced, most of whom are in need of
           humanitarian assistance, and that new civilian displacements have occurred in the
           first and second quarters of 2018 as a result of clashes in Jebel Marra, that these
           clashes have also negatively impacted humanitarian operations in those areas, and
           calling on the Government of Sudan to facilitate immediately unhindered access for
           UNAMID and humanitarian actors to populations in need of humanitarian assistance,
           including those in areas of conflict,
                 Welcoming some improvements in the protective environment, and noting the
           reduction in the number of reported cases of human rights vi olations and abuses,
           while recognising UNAMID’s reduced ability to monitor and verify reported human
           rights violations and abuses in the areas from which it has withdrawn and expressing
           concern that IDPs continue to face grave security threats including being killed,
           raped, or harassed as they conduct life-sustaining activities outside the camps and the
           worrying levels of sexual and gender-based violence and grave violations against
           children, as well as findings in February 2018 from the UN Special Represen tative of
           the Secretary General on Sexual Violence in Conflict that indicated an increase in
           sexual violence against children in Darfur, that victims of sexual violence often face
           denial, shame and stigma preventing them from reporting the crime or seeking
           assistance, further compounding their suffering, and denial of justice and
           accountability,
                 Encouraging the Government of Sudan to swiftly ensure that the UNAMID team
           sites already handed over and team sites that will be handed over in the future are
           utilised in line with the agreements made between UNAMID and Government of
           Sudan,
                 Underlining the importance of the Government of Sudan addressing the root
           causes of conflict and extending state authority, including through the strengthening
           of the rule of law and respect for human rights throughout Darfur in order to make
           the transition to peacebuilding possible and which should rapidly deliver real benefits
           for the people of Darfur,
                Recognising the adverse effects of climate change, ecological changes and
           natural disasters, among other factors, on the situation in Darfur, including through
           drought, desertification, land degradation and food insecurity,
                 Recognising that the current national economic and fuel crisis in Sudan is having
           a negative impact on the humanitarian situation, food security, and the ability of the
           Sudanese government institutions, including the police, to provide services and
           access to areas of Darfur, expressing concern that the total number of people in need
           of humanitarian assistance in Sudan has increased from 5.5 million to 7.1 million as
           a result, and calling on the Government of Sudan to ensure safe and unhindered
           humanitarian access to meet the urgent needs of this population, and calling on
           donors, the regional authorities in Darfur, and the Government of Sudan to provide
           the financial resources necessary to reach those in need, including through the United
           Nations Country Team, and to undertake activities in support of the transition to
           peacebuilding, and urging the Government of Sudan and the local authorities to
           ensure there is an environment conducive to the provision of such activities, including
           improving access for development and peacebuilding actors,
                Urging the Government of Sudan to ensure that the Darfur Peace Follow-up
           Office is properly resourced in order to continue implementation of the work of the
           former Darfur Regional Authority and the Commissions, urging donors and the

S/RES/2429 (2018)

               Government of Sudan to honour their pledges and fulfil their obligations in a timely
               manner, including those commitments made at the conference in Doha in April 2013,
                    Affirming that development can support a lasting peace in Darfur, noting that
               the Darfur Development Strategy only extends through 2019 and calling on the
               Government of Sudan and donors to engage and support the strategic review of the
               Darfur Development Strategy, with a view to extending it to 2025, and further calling
               on donors to ensure their funding is adequately aligned to Darfur ’s current
               development needs,
                      Recalling the commitments made by the Government of Sudan and other
               signatories to the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDP D) to ensure the
               unhindered access of humanitarian assistance to the population in need and the
               protection of humanitarian workers and their operations in areas under their control,
               as well as to guarantee UNAMID unfettered freedom of movement in all areas and at
               all times in Darfur in the exercise of its mandate, and further recalling the role of the
               Implementation Follow-up Commission (IFC) in assessing the implementation of the
               DDPD,

               Political situation
                     Reiterating that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Darfur, and
               that an inclusive political settlement is essential to ensuring peace, and underscoring
               the importance of fully addressing the root causes of the conflict, including
               management of land, water and other resources, in this regard reaffirming its support
               for the DDPD as a viable framework to address the root causes of the conflict,
               including for the peace process in Darfur, and for its accelerated implementation and
               noting that UNAMID’s ability to facilitate progress in implementation of the DDPD
               is hampered by delays and the absence of an inclusive political settlement between
               the Government of Sudan and non-signatory armed movements,
                     Reiterating its support for the African Union High Level Implementation Panel
               (AUHIP) and the Roadmap, regretting the lack of progress in implementation, and
               urging all parties to immediately re-engage in negotiations with the AUHIP on the
               Roadmap to make immediate progress on the implementation of the Roadmap,
               including the signing of cessation of hostilities and humanitarian assistance
               agreements among the parties consistent with the first phase of the Roadmap, urging
               the signatories to consider mutually acceptable, viable options for the implementation
               of the Roadmap and further urging non-signatory groups to join negotiations without
               delay,
                     Noting that the Government of Sudan has continued to express its openness for
               outstanding opposition groups to join the Sudan National Dialogue process, and
               encouraging the Government of Sudan to create a more conducive and inclusive
               environment that would enable outstanding opposition groups to contribute to this
               process, including by contributing to the recommendations agreed in the national
               document, modalities for their implementation, and to join the National Dialogue
               process that would include the drafting of a new constitution,
                     Noting that local dispute resolution mechanisms play an important role in
               preventing and resolving inter-communal conflict, including conflict over natural
               resources, urging an intensification of effective efforts to prevent local disputes
               leading to violence, with its corresponding impact on the local civilian populations,
               acknowledging the efforts of Sudanese authorities, with the support of UNAMID,
               efforts of the United Nations Country Team and civil society, particularly through the
               Darfur Community Peace and Stability Fund (DCPSF), in this regard, welcoming the
               encouraging conclusion of several inter-communal peace agreements, with support
               from UNAMID, the United Nations Country Team and civil society, and urging their

4/15                                                                                                       18-11690

                                                                                                  S/RES/2429 (2018)

           continued work in collaboration with the Government of Sudan to find sustainable
           solutions to these conflicts,
                 Welcoming regional and other initiatives, undertaken in close interaction with
           the Government of Sudan, to address the root causes of the conflict in Darfur and to
           promote a sustainable peace, commending the efforts of the AU-HIP, led by President
           Thabo Mbeki and the efforts of the Joint Special Representative (JSR) to secure
           peace, stability and security in Darfur, including through support to international,
           regional and national efforts to revitalise the peace process and increase its
           inclusiveness,
                 Calling on all parties to comply with their obligations under international human
           rights law and international humanitarian law, stressing the importance that the
           Council attaches to ending impunity including through ensuring accountability and
           bringing to justice the perpetrators of crimes, including sexual and gender-based
           violence, committed by all parties in Darfur, urging the Government of Sudan to
           comply with its obligations in this respect, recognising the role of the Special
           Prosecutor for Darfur appointed by the Government of Sudan, particularly with
           respect to cases of sexual and gender-based violence, and stressing the need for
           progress in particular in investigating and prosecuting sexual and gender -based
           violence cases with respect to perpetrators on all sides, reiterating the call for swift
           progress on the draft Memorandum of Understanding providing for UNAMID and
           African Union observation of the proceedings of the Special Court, and calling on the
           Government of Sudan to investigate swiftly attacks against U NAMID, and to bring
           the perpetrators to justice,
                 Reaffirming its concern over the negative effect of instability in Darfur on the
           stability of Sudan as a whole as well as the region, expressing serious concern at the
           presence of Darfur armed movements in conflict areas outside Sudan and their
           involvement in migrant smuggling, criminal activity banditry and mercenary
           activities and encouraging cooperation between regional state actors to address crossborder issues, such as weapons smuggling, in order to ac hieve peace and stability in
           Darfur and the wider region, and recalling in this regard the arms embargo as
           contained in paragraph 9 of resolution 1556 (2004) and paragraph 7 of resolution
           1591 (2005), as updated in paragraph 9 of resolution 1945 (2010) and paragraph 4 of
           resolution 2035 (2012),
                 Commending UNAMID for the successful implementation of resolution 2363,
           in particular the completion of phase one and two of its reconfiguration and
           reiterating its full support for UNAMID,
                Noting with appreciation the Special Report of the Secretary-General and the
           Chairperson of the African Union Commission of 1 June 2018 ( S/2018/530) (the
           ‘Special Report’),
                 Welcoming the improvement in freedom of movement for UNAMID as well as
           in the issuance of visas for UNAMID staff and the processing of UNAMID containers,
           but expressing concern that restrictions remain in place, including restrictions from
           the Government of Sudan on the conduct of night patrols all over Darfur and
           restrictions preventing UNAMID and humanitarian actors from reaching areas where
           there are instances of conflict in a timely fashion in response to the ongoing reports
           of violent incidents in the Jebel Marra area, and that obstacles, including bureaucratic
           obstacles, imposed on UNAMID continue to jeopardise its ability to deliver on its
           mandate, including visa restrictions targeted at some elements of UNAMID,
           particularly the human rights section, and ongoing delays in the processing of
           UNAMID containers, recognising the Government of Sudan’s commitment to
           cooperate with UNAMID and humanitarian personnel on all logistical issues and
           calling on the Government of Sudan to honour continuously its commitment in full

18-11690                                                                                                       5/15

S/RES/2429 (2018)

               to ensure that humanitarian personnel and UNAMID can operate in support of
               addressing basic needs,
                    Determining that the situation in Sudan constitutes a threat to international
               peace and security,
                    1.    Decides to extend until 30 June 2019 the mandate of UNAMID;
                     2.    Recalls its support in resolution 2363 (2017) for UNAMID to adopt a twopronged approach as set out in paragraph 2 of resolution 2363 (2017), reiterates its
               continued support for this approach, takes note of the recommendations in the

           participation of women during all stages of peace processes, particularly in conflict
           resolution, post-conflict planning and peacebuilding, including women’s civil society

           countries and, as appropriate, UNAMID, to take the steps necessary to conduct
           investigations of allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse as expedit iously as
           possible, and in line with the Secretary-General’s request, further urges all troop- and
           police contributing countries to take appropriate steps to hold accountable those
           personnel responsible for sexual exploitation and abuse and further stresses the need
           to prevent such exploitation and abuse and to improve how these allegations are
           addressed in line with resolution 2272 (2016);
                 37. Recalls its Presidential Statement S/PRST/2015/22 and its resolution 2272

           full compliance of UNAMID with the Secretary General’s zero tolerance policy on
           sexual exploitation and abuse and to ensure that all personnel of the mission are vetted
           for history of sexual misconduct in the service with the United Nations and to keep it
           informed through his reports about UNAMID’s progress in this regard, and urges
           troop- and police-contributing countries to take appropriate preventative action
           including the delivery of robust sexual exploitation and abuse pre -deployment
           awareness training, and to ensure full accountability in cases of such condu ct
           involving their personnel;
                 38. Welcomes the Government of Sudan’s completion of the Action Plan for
           the Protection of Children from violations in armed conflict, to inter alia end child
           recruitment and use in its armed and security forces, and the de -listing of the
           Government of Sudan from the Secretary General’s report on Children and Armed
           Conflict in this regard, encourages the Government of Sudan to sustain preventative
           efforts by transforming the Action Plan into a National Prevention Plan of grave
           violations against children, to continue to operationalise the complaint mechanism on
           a community level, to strengthen birth registration and awareness -raising, demands

S/RES/2429 (2018)

                     (b) continued dialogue with the parties to the conflict towards the
               development and implementation of the aforementioned action plans, in accordance

               conflict;
                     39. Strongly condemns all killings resulting from inter-communal conflicts
               and other attacks against civilians by militia and armed elements, recognises that
               local/traditional dispute mechanisms have their limitations in addressing serious
               criminal and human rights abuses resulting from inter-communal conflicts and armed
               violence such as killings, injuries, abduction, sexual and gender-based violence
               destruction of property and livelihoods, and notes the recurrent nature of these
               inter-communal conflicts and the threat to civilian protection, peace and stability,
               urges the Government of Sudan, with the support of UNAMID and the United Nations
               Country Team, to address the ongoing impunity through ensuring accountability for
               human rights abuses and violations in situations of inter-communal conflicts in Darfur
               as well as attacks perpetrated by militias;
                     40. Expresses deep concern over the continued large volumes of arms, in
               particular small arms and light weapons that remain in Darfur and the use of such
               arms against civilians, including by militia, acknowledges the Government of Sudan’s
               efforts to reduce the number of weapons in Darfur through the arms collections
               campaign and its reported contribution to improving security conditions, requests
               UNAMID to continue to cooperate in this context with the Panel of Experts in o rder
               to facilitate their work, and encourages UNAMID to continue to provide technical
               and logistical assistance to the Sudan DDR Commission and urges the Government
               of Sudan to conduct a genuine, indiscriminate and comprehensive disarmament
               process, consistent with international small arms control standards, in full cooperation
               with UNAMID;

               Humanitarian situation and displacement
                     41. Condemns all violations of international humanitarian law and violations
               and abuses of human rights, including those involving any form of sexual and genderbased violence, in particular the deliberate targeting of civilians, indiscriminate or
               disproportionate attacks; and demands that all parties in Darfur immediately end
               attacks targeting civilians, peacekeepers and humanitarian personnel, and comply
               with their obligations under international human rights law and international
               humanitarian law as applicable and that the Government of Sudan hold perpetrators
               accountable;

               threats to and attacks on humanitarian personnel and facilities; acknowledges
               improvements in humanitarian access, and expresses concern that access to some
               conflict areas where vulnerable populations reside remains restricted inc luding in
               areas of conflict and insecurity, and at ongoing movement restrictions and
               bureaucratic impediments on humanitarian access by government forces, and to a
               lesser extent by militia groups and armed movements;
                     43. Expresses concern over the insufficient availability of funding for
               humanitarian actors; stresses the need for the timely issuing of visas and travel
               permits for humanitarian organisations, the rapid processing of technical agreements
               and reduced restrictions on recruitment and employment of personnel and the
               selection of partners; and demands that the Government of Sudan, all militia groups,
               including auxiliary units of the Government of Sudan forces, armed movements and
               all other stakeholders ensure the safe, timely impartial and unhinder ed access of
               humanitarian organisations and relief personnel, and the delivery of humanitarian
               assistance to populations in need throughout Darfur, in accordance with the relevant


12/15                                                                                                     18-11690

                                                                                                    S/RES/2429 (2018)

           provisions of international law and United Nations guiding principles of humanitarian
           assistance, including humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence;
                 44. Welcomes some improvements in the human rights situation, but condemns
           ongoing human rights violations and abuses in, and relating to, Darfur, including
           those involving extrajudicial killings, the excessive use of force, abduction of
           civilians, acts of sexual and gender-based violence, grave violations against children,
           and arbitrary arrests and detentions; calls on the Government of Sudan to investigate
           allegations of such violations and abuses and bring those responsible to justice;
           expresses deep concern about the situation of all those so detained, including civil
           society members, IDPs and a UNAMID human rights monitor; emphasises the
           importance of ensuring, within its current mandate, UNAMID’s and other relevant
           organisations’ ability to monitor such cases and in this regard urges the Government
           of Sudan to extend full cooperation to UNAMID towards fulfilment of this goal and
           to provide accountability and access to justice for victims; calls on the Government
           of Sudan fully to respect its obligations, including by fulfilling its commitment to lift
           the state of emergency in Darfur, releasing all political prisoners, ensuring free
           expression and ensuring UNAMID monitors’ access and freedom of movement,
           including by refraining from arresting and detaining UNAMID staff;
                 45. Notes the Government of Sudan’s stated desire to see the displaced return
           to their areas of origin or resettle in their current areas of displacement ; stresses that
           any returns should safe, dignified, voluntary and in accordance with applicable
           international law; welcomes the increase in the number of returns but regrets that
           many of these returns have been unsustainable because root causes of the conf lict
           such as the absence of security, basic services, livelihoods, opportunities, and access
           to land and water in areas of return have not been sufficiently addressed; and further
           stresses the importance of achieving dignified and durable solutions for ref ugees and
           IDPs, and of ensuring their full participation in the planning and management of these
           solutions;
                 46. Demands that all parties to the conflict in Darfur create the conditions
           conducive to allowing the voluntary, informed, safe, dignified and sus tainable return
           of refugees and IDPs, or, where appropriate, their local integration or relocation to a
           third location and within the context of its protection of civilians mandate, welcomes
           UNAMID’s renewed effort to enhance the protection of IDPs; stresses the need for
           the establishment of a mechanism in order to verify the extent to which these returns
           are voluntary and informed in nature, and underlines the importance of addressing
           land issues for the realisation of durable solutions in Darfur;
                 47. Requests the United Nations and the Government of Sudan to consider the
           adverse implications of climate change, other ecological changes and natural
           disasters, among other factors, in their programmes in Darfur, including by
           undertaking risk assessments and risk management strategies relating to these factors
           and further requests the Secretary-General to provide information of such assessments
           in mandated reporting as appropriate;

           Operational Challenges
                 48. Pays tribute to the UNAMID personnel who have paid the ultimate
           sacrifice in the line of duty for the cause of peace in Darfur; urges UNAMID to take
           all necessary measures within its rules of engagement to protect United Nations
           personnel and equipment; condemns the ongoing impunity for those who attack
           peacekeepers, and in this regard urges the Government of Sudan to do its utmost to
           bring all perpetrators of any such crimes to justice and to cooperate with UNAMID
           to this end;



18-11690                                                                                                        13/15

S/RES/2429 (2018)

                     49. Welcomes increased opportunities for explosive remnants of war clearance
               with improvements in the security situation in some parts of Darfur, underscores that
               UNAMID, in cooperation with UNMAS, should continue to undertake clearance
               efforts with a particular focus on areas of return, and further requests UNAMID to
               cooperate with relevant partners, including the National Mine Action Centre,
               UNICEF, UNDP and ICRC to prepare for transition of the expected remaining work
               load upon UNAMID’s eventual exit;
                     50. Acknowledges continued improvements in the issuance of visas and the
               clearance of UNAMID shipments, freedom of movement and the processing of travel
               documents, reiterates its concern that some hindrances remain to UNAMID in the
               implementation of its mandate, including that some elements of UNAMID,
               particularly the human rights section, continue to suffer from targeted visa
               restrictions, ongoing delays in the processing of UNAMID containers, movement and
               access restrictions, caused by insecurity, acts of criminality and significant movement
               restrictions by the Government of Sudan, militia groups and armed movements,
               including restrictions from the Government of Sudan on the conduct of night patrols
               all over Darfur and other restrictions preventing UNAMID from reaching ar eas where
               there are instances of inter-communal conflict in a timely fashion; calls on all parties
               in Darfur to remove all obstacles to UNAMID’s full and proper discharge of its
               mandate, including by ensuring its security and freedom of movement; and in th is
               regard, demands that the Government of Sudan, communicating and collaborating
               closely with its various agencies and all levels of local government bodies, recommit
               to and comply with the Status of Forces Agreement fully and without delay,
               particularly provisions relevant to the movement of patrols in conflict -affected areas
               and flight clearances, as well as those provisions relevant to the removal of obstacles
               to the use of UNAMID aerial assets, the timely processing of UNAMID ’s equipment
               and rations at the port of entry to Sudan, and the timely issuing of visas;
                     51. Requests the Government of Sudan to grant expeditiously clearance for
               UNAMID flights between the five states of Darfur in order to ensure the Mission has
               a higher degree of flexibility and that this approval be communicated promptly with
               its various agencies and all levels of local government bodies, and underlines that the
               reconfiguration of UNAMID should be effectively accompanied by an improved
               ability to respond to threats quickly and adequately in order to protect civilians;
                     52. Expresses concern that UNAMID has been prevented from routinely
               returning to areas where it has closed team sites despite agreement with the
               Government of Sudan to allow them to do so, urges the Government of Sudan to
               ensure that UNAMID has unfettered access throughout Darfur, including to the areas
               from which it has withdrawn;

               Exit strategy
                     53. Requests the Secretary General’s initial 90 day report to include a detailed
               and clearly benchmarked exit strategy for UNAMID based upon the recommendation
               in the Special Report (S/2018/530) (Annex) that provisions of the DDPD could serve
               as the basis for indicators of achievement for the eventual exit of UNAMID, as well
               as existing Mission benchmarks and further updates as necessary, and with particular
               focus on those benchmarks and indicators for which Government of Sudan has
               responsibility in the areas of protection of civilians, security sector reform, rule of
               law, durable solutions and human rights, further requests that this report includes a
               recommendation on how progress against the comprehensive exit benchmarks should
               be monitored;
                     54. Takes note of consultations between the United Nations, the African Union
               and the Government of Sudan, notably in the frameworks of the Tripartite mechanism
               and the Joint Working Group over the past year, including discussion of operational

14/15                                                                                                     18-11690

                                                                                                   S/RES/2429 (2018)

           and logistical issues pertaining to the Mission’s operation as well as the Mission’s
           exit strategy;
                 55. Calls upon UNAMID to work closely with the United Nations Country
           Team to identify ways to address gaps in capabilities to prepare for the Mission ’s exit,
           including a resource mobilisation plan to deliver the transition of those
           responsibilities, and further calls upon UNAMID, the United Nations Country Team,
           and all relevant UN agencies in consultation with the Government, to coordinate
           closely in the transfer of these responsibilities, and encourages the international
           community and donors to support the scaling up of the activities and programming of
           the United Nations Country Team in assisting the Government of Sudan ’s continued
           efforts to maintain a sustainable peace;

           Reporting
                56. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Council every 90 days
