           under the leadership of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, as an
           integrated special political mission, in full accordance with the principles of

           consistent presence in Libya to support the Presidency Council and Temporary
           Security Committee and encourages UNSMIL to continue working towards
           re-establishing a permanent presence in Libya through a phased return, as security
           conditions allow and to make the necessary security arrangements to this effect;
                4.    Looks forward to the outcome of Secretary-General’s Strategic
           Assessment Review in early 2017 and stands ready to review the mandate of the
           Mission as a result if needed;
               5.    Requests the Secretary-General to continue to report to the Security
           Council on the implementation of this resolution at least every 60 days;
                6.     Requests the Secretary-General to report as necessary following
           consultations with the Libyan authorities on recommendations for UNSMIL’s
           support to the subsequent phases of the Libyan transition process and UNSMIL’s
           security arrangements;
                7.    Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
