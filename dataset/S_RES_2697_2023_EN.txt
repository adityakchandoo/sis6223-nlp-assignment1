                    The Security Council,
                    Reaffirming its resolutions 1265 (1999), 1325 (2000), 1368 (2001), 1373 (2001),
               1624 (2005), 1894 (2009), 2106 (2013), 2150 (2014), 2170 (2014), 2178 (2014), 2199

                    Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence
               and unity of Iraq, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the
               United Nations,
                     Recalling that ISIL/Da’esh constitutes a global threat to international peace and
               security through its terrorist acts, its violent extremist ideology, its continued gross,
               systematic and widespread attacks directed against civilians, its violations of
               international humanitarian law and abuses of human rights, particularly those
               committed against women and children, and including those motivated by religious
               or ethnic grounds, and its recruitment and training of foreign terrorist fighters whose
               threat affects all regions and Member States,
                     Condemning the commission of acts by ISIL/Da’esh involving murder,
               kidnapping, hostage-taking, suicide bombings, enslavement, sale into or otherwise
               forced marriage, trafficking in persons, rape, sexual slavery and other forms of sexual
               violence, recruitment and use of children, attacks on critical infrastructure, as well as
               its destruction of cultural heritage, including archaeological sites, and trafficking of
               cultural property,
                     Recognizing that the commission of such acts which may amount to war crimes,
               crimes against humanity or genocide, is part of the ideology and strategic objectives
               of ISIL/Da’esh, and used by ISIL/Da’esh as a tactic of terrorism, and that holding
               ISIL/Da’esh members accountable, particularly those who bear the greatest
               responsibility, including in terms of leadership, which can include regional or
               mid-level commanders, and the ordering and commission of crimes, will further
               expose this, and could assist in countering terrorism and violent extremism which can
               be conducive to terrorism, including by stemming financing and the continued flow
               of international recruits to the terrorist group ISIL/Da’esh,
