               United Nations                                                               S/RES/2623 (2022)
               Security Council                                              Distr.: General
                                                                             27 February 2022




               Resolution 2623 (2022)
               Adopted by the Security Council at its 8980th meeting, on
               27 February 2022

                    The Security Council,
                    Having considered the item on the agenda of its 8979th meeting, as contained
               in document S/Agenda/8979,
                    Taking into account that the lack of unanimity of its permanent members at the
               8979th meeting has prevented it from exercising its primary responsibility for the
               maintenance of international peace and security,
                   Decides to call an emergency special session of the General Assembly to
               examine the question contained in document S/Agenda/8979.
