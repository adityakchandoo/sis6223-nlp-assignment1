               Security Council                                                    Distr.: General
                                                                                   27 January 2022

               Adopted by the Security Council at its 8956th meeting, on
               27 January 2022

                    The Security Council,
                     Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General of 31 December 2021 on his
               Good Offices (S/2021/1109) and on the United Nations operation in Cyprus
               (S/2021/1110), and expressing its full support for his Good Offices, including the
               existing body of work, to remain available to assist the sides,
                     Underscoring that the responsibility for finding a solution lies first and foremost
               with the Cypriots themselves, and reaffirming the primary role of the United Nations
               in assisting the parties to bring the Cyprus conflict and division of the island to a
               comprehensive and durable settlement with a sense of urgency,
                     Welcoming the continuing personal engagement of the Secretary-General and
               that of his team, including his proposal for a United Nations envoy to lead further
               engagement which could provide critical support in the search for common ground
               with the goal of returning to formal negotiations as set out in his Good Offices re port
               (S/2021/1109),
                     Expressing full support for the Secretary-General’s ongoing efforts and reiterating
               the importance of openness, flexibility and compromise in finding common ground with
               the goal of returning to formal negotiations, and urging the sides to renew their efforts
               to achieve an enduring, comprehensive and just settlement based on a bicommunal,
               bizonal federation with political equality, as set out in relevant Security Council
               resolutions, including paragraph 4 of its resolution 716 (1991),
                     Noting with regret the lack of progress made towards restarting formal
               negotiations at this time and stressing that the status quo is unsustainable, that the
               situation on the ground is not static, and that the lack of an agreement furthers political
               tensions and deepens the estrangement of both communities, risking irreversible
               changes on the ground, and reducing the prospects of a settlement,
                     Recalling its Presidential Statement (S/PRST/2021/13), and all relevant
               resolutions and statements of its President regarding Varosha,
                     Recalling its resolution 1325 (2000) and all related resolutions, recognising that
               the full, equal and meaningful participation and leadership of women is essential in
               building peace in Cyprus and will contribute to making any future settlement
               sustainable, welcoming efforts to bring together a broader range of women actors on
               both sides and the joint action plan on ensuring women’s participation in peace talks,

                     Recalling its resolution 2250 (2015) and related resolutions that recognise the
               important and positive contribution of youth in efforts for the maintenance and
               promotion of peace and security, and as a key aspect of the sustainability,
               inclusiveness and success of peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts, and further
               encourages the full, equal and meaningful participation of youth in this process,

               sides on epidemiological issues, and encouraging further cooperation in this area, in
               particular initiatives to enable greater access to safe and effective COVID-19
               vaccines, and echoing the Secretary-General’s finding that COVID-19 has further

               UNFICYP to establish effective measures to tackle criminal activities,
                     Reiterating the importance of confidence-building measures and their timely

               reconciliation and the active engagement of civil society, in particular women and
               youth, and recognising that regular, effective contact and communication between the
               sides enhances the prospects for settlement and is in the interests of all Cypriots, and

                    Noting that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in view of the prevailing
               conditions on the island it is necessary to keep the United Nations Peacekeeping Force
               in Cyprus (UNFICYP) beyond 31 January 2022,
                     Welcoming measures to date to strengthen the liaison and engagement capacity

               settlement and in line with resolution 2594 (2021) and other relevant resolutions, and

               UNFICYP, to ensure efficiency and effectiveness,
                   Expressing appreciation to Member States that contribute personnel to

                                                                                                   S/RES/2618 (2022)

           flexibility and compromise and to show the necessary political will and commitment
           to freely negotiate a mutually acceptable settlement under United Nations auspices,

           reiterates that no actions should be carried out in relation to Varosha that are not in

           and enable them to function effectively in coordination and cooperation on matters

           expertise available in the bicommunal Technical Committees on Health, Criminal
           Matters, Crisis Management, Humanitarian Affairs and Economic Matters, and to
           empower them to submit proposals for their consideration to enhance intercommunal

           policy-making, and to address impediments to peace by conducting a joint review of
           school materials, including text books, as a contribution to trust -building between the
           communities, on which there continues to be no progress;
                 (d) improve the public atmosphere for negotiation to secure a settlement,
           including by preparing the communities for a settlement through public messages on
