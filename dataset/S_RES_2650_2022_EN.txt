           verdict by the Permanent Military Court with respect to two serious attacks against
           UNIFIL peacekeepers on 26 July and 9 December 2011,
                Recalling the importance of ensuring the protection of children and taking
           appropriate measures in this regard, in line with relevant Security Council resolutions

               its forces and as it deems within its capabilities, to ensure that its area of operations
               is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind and to resist attempts by forceful means
               to prevent it from discharging its mandate,
                     Welcoming the crucial role played by the Lebanese Armed Forces and security
               forces, as the only legitimate armed forces in Lebanon, in extending and sustaining
               the authority of the Government of Lebanon, in particular in southern Lebanon, and
               responding to other security challenges, including the threat of terrorism, and the
               strong international commitment to support the Lebanese Armed Forces, which has
               helped strengthen the capability of the Lebanese Armed Forces to provide security
               for Lebanon, strongly urging further and increased international support to the
               Lebanese Armed Forces in the context of the current economic crisis, and further

               with UNIFIL in the implementation of the UNIFIL mandate, and calling upon
               Member States to urgently assist the Lebanese Armed Forces as needed to enable it
               to perform its duties in line with resolution 1701 (2006),
                    Expressing concern about the strong negative impact of the current social,
               economic and humanitarian crises on the capacities of the Lebanese Armed Forces
               and security forces,
                     Recalling resolution 2378 (2017) and its request of the Secretary-General to
               ensure that data related to the effectiveness of peacekeeping operations, including

               peacekeeping operations,
                     Emphasizing the need to regularly review all peacekeeping operations to ensure
               efficiency and effectiveness, including reviews of UNIFIL when appropriate, taking
               into account developments on the ground,
                     Bearing in mind the strategic priorities and recommendations identified by the

                                                                                                  S/RES/2650 (2022)

                 2.   Commends the positive role of UNIFIL, whose deployment together with
           the Lebanese Armed Forces has helped to establish a new strategic environment in
           southern Lebanon, welcomes the expansion of coordinated activities between UNIFIL
           and the Lebanese Armed Forces, and calls for further enhancement of this cooperation
           without prejudice to UNIFIL’s mandate;
                3.     Affirms its strong continuing commitment to the existing UNIFIL mandate

           at an accelerated pace to fully implement the provisions of resolution 1701 (2006)
           and requests the Secretary-General to include in his future reports assessments of
           progress made in this regard and calls for renewed engagement of UNIFIL and the
           Lebanese Armed Forces in the Strategic Dialogue, which aims at carryin g out analysis
           of ground forces and maritime assets and setting a series of benchmarks reflecting the
           correlation between the capacities and responsibilities of UNIFIL vis -à-vis those of
           the Lebanese Armed Forces;
                 6.  Reiterates its request for precise benchmarks and timelines to be jointly
           and promptly elaborated by the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Secretary -General,
           for the deployments in paragraph 5, with a view to identifying Lebanese Armed
           Forces progress in implementing tasks mandated in resolution 1701 (2006);
                7.     Reiterates its call for the Government of Lebanon to present a plan to
           increase its naval capabilities as soon as possible, including with appropriate suppo rt
           from the international community, with the goal of ultimately decreasing UNIFIL’s
           Maritime Taskforce and transitioning its responsibilities to the Lebanese Armed
           Forces (LAF), in close conjunction with the effective build -up of the capabilities of
           the Lebanese Navy, takes note in that regard of the letter dated 12 March 2019 to the
           United Nations outlining the commitment of the Government of Lebanon and

           continued relevance of UNIFIL’s resources and options for improving the efficiency
           and effectiveness between UNIFIL and UNSCOL, taking into consideration the troop
           ceiling and the civilian component of UNIFIL (S/2020/473) and requests the
           Secretary-General to continue the implementation of his detailed plan, with timelines
           and specific modalities, in full and close consultation with the parties, including
           Lebanon, the troop-contributing countries and the Members of the Security Council,
           to implement recommendations, as appropriate, and further requests him to
           periodically update the Security Council on this process;
                 9.   Strongly encourages the Government of Lebanon to accelerate its
           deployment of a model regiment and an offshore patrol vessel in UNIFIL’s area of
           operations to advance the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) and the authority
           of the Lebanese State, recalls in this regard the joint statement issued at the end of
           the 15 March 2018 Rome Conference, in particular Lebanon’s concept for a new
           Model Regiment proposed in the context of the ongoing Strategic Dialogue between
