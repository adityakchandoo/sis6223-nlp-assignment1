               the absence of a link to a specific terrorist act, and urging States when designing and
               applying measures to counter the financing of terrorism, to take into account the
               potential effect of those measures on exclusively humanitarian activities, including
               medical activities, that are carried out by impartial humanitarian actors in a manner
               consistent with international humanitarian law,
