                     Reiterating the urgent need to end impunity in South Sudan and to bring to
               justice all those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and
               violations and abuses of human rights, stressing the importance of transitional
               justice measures, including those in the Revitalised Agreement, to end impunity,

               any transitional justice mechanisms for South Sudan including those established
               pursuant to the Revitalised Agreement, stressing the importance of collection and
               preservation of evidence for eventual use by the Hybrid Court for South Sudan and
               other accountability mechanisms, and encouraging efforts in this regard,

           civilians, declining to participate in or undertake long-range patrols in rural parts of
