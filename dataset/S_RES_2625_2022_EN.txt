               war crimes, further condemning the obstructions by all parties to civilians’ movement
               and to humanitarian actors’ movement to reach civilians in need of assi stance,

           humanitarian law,

           international humanitarian law by all parties, including armed groups and nationa l

           protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes
           against humanity, and expressing concern that despite the signing of the Revitalised
           Agreement, violations and abuses including rape and sexual violence continue to
           occur which may amount to international crimes, including war crimes and crimes
           against humanity,

           19 February 2021 that war crimes and crimes against humanity may have been
           committed, emphasizing its expectation that these and other credible reports will be
           duly considered by any transitional justice mechanisms for South Sudan including
           those established pursuant to the Revitalised Agreement, stressing the importance of
           collection and preservation of evidence for eventual use by the Hybrid Court for South
           Sudan and other accountability mechanisms, and encouraging efforts in this regard,
                 Reiterating the urgent need to end impunity in South Sudan and to bring to
           justice all those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and
           violations and abuses of human rights, stressing the importance of transitional justice
           measures included in Chapter V of the Revitalised Agreement, to end impunity and
           promote accountability, facilitate national reconciliation and healing, and ensure a
           sustainable peace, particularly those efforts undertaken by the UN-mandated
           Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, and in this regard, recognizing the
           operationalization of a Gender-Based Violence and Juvenile Court by the Judiciary of
           South Sudan, acknowledging the approval by the Government of South Sudan (GoSS)

S/RES/2625 (2022)

                     Underlining that any obstruction of UNMISS by any party is unacceptable,
               including restrictions on freedom of movement, assault of UNMISS personnel, and
               constraints on mission operations, including restrictions on patrols and UNMISS
               efforts to, inter alia, monitor the human rights situation, many of which were reported
               by the Secretary-General as violations of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) by
               the GoSS, acknowledging a reduction of SOFA violations in 2021 and urging the
               GoSS to continue progress in this regard, and recalling that, according to the SOFA,
               UNMISS, as well as its contractors, shall enjoy full and unrestricted freedom of
               movement without delay throughout South Sudan by the most direct route possible
               without the need for travel permits or prior authorization or notification, and the right

               duty, taxes, fees and charges and free of other prohibitions and restrictions,
                    Recalling its resolution 2117 (2013) and expressing grave concern at the threat
               to peace and security in South Sudan arising from the illicit transfer, destabilizing
               accumulation and misuse of small arms and light weapons, and further expressing
               concern that illicit trafficking, and diversion of arms and related materiel of all types
               undermine the rule of law, and has the potential to undermine respect for international
               humanitarian law, can impede the provision of humanitarian assistance and have
               wide-ranging negative humanitarian and socioeconomic consequences,
                     Noting the measures adopted by the Security Council in resolution 2428 (2018)
               and renewed in 2471 (2019), 2521 (2020), and 2577 (2021) recalling that individuals
               or entities responsible for or complicit in, or having engaged in, directly or indirectly,
               actions or policies that threaten the peace, security or stability of South Sudan, may
               be designated for targeted sanctions, further recalling its willingness to impose
               targeted sanctions, and stressing the critical importance of effective implementation
               of the sanctions regime, including its travel ban measures, and the key role that
               neighboring states, as well as regional and subregional organizations, can play in this
               regard, encouraging efforts to further enhance cooperation, and reiterating its
               readiness to consider adjusting measures, including through modifying, suspending,
               lifting or strengthening measures to respond to the situation,
                     Emphasizing that persistent barriers to full implementation of resolution 1325
               (2000), and subsequent resolutions addressing women, peace, and security, including
               resolution 2242 (2015), will only be dismantled through dedicated commitment to
               women’s empowerment, participation, and human rights, concerted leadership,
               consistent information and action, and support, to build women’s full, equal, and
               meaningful participation in all levels of decision-making and leadership,
                    Acknowledging the significance of the GoSS’s ratification of the Optional

               expression, and association, acknowledging the important role of those who protect
               and promote human rights, civil society organizations, journalists and other media
               workers in the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and
               expression and, in this context, expressing deep concern that violations and abuses of
               the right to freedom of opinion and expression continue to occur, and condemning the
               use of media to broadcast hate speech and transmit messages instigating violence
               against a particular ethnic group, a practice that has the potential to lead to widespread
               violence and exacerbate armed conflict, particularly as South Sudan approaches
               elections,
                    Expressing serious concern about the dire situation of persons with disabilities
               in South Sudan, including abandonment, violence, and lack of access to basic

           services, and emphasizing the need to ensure that the particular needs of persons with
           disabilities are addressed in the humanitarian response,
                 Recognizing the adverse effects of climate change, ecological changes, and
           natural disasters, among other factors, on the humanitarian situation and stability in
           South Sudan, emphasizing the need for comprehensive risk assessments and risk
           management strategies by the GoSS and the United Nations to inform programs
           relating to these factors, and acknowledging the United Nations Framework
           Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement,
                 Commending the work of UNMISS, and expressing its deep appreciation for the
           actions taken by UNMISS peacekeepers and troop- and police-contributing countries
           in implementing the UNMISS mandate in a challenging environment, including in

           operations, acknowledging that its efficient use is crucial to the effective
           implementation of UNMISS’ mandate, emphasizing the need to continue to improve

           activities into both planning and day-to-day operational decisions of missions,
           including UNMISS, as stated in its Action for Peacekeeping Plus Plan,
                 Welcoming the commitment of the Secretary-General to enforce strictly his zerotolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse, noting the various measures taken
           by UNMISS and troop- and police-contributing countries to combat sexual

           sexual exploitation and abuse by those units, to take appropriate disciplinary

                 28. Stresses the ongoing need for bilateral and multilateral partners to work

           in doing so in a comprehensive written report to be submitted within 90 days of the
           date of adoption of this resolution, every 90 days thereafter, and underscores that such
           reporting should provide integrated, evidence-based and data-driven analysis,
           strategic assessments and frank advice to the Security Council and should include
           attention to:
               • Whether and how each of its activities undertaken pursuant to paragraph 3 have
