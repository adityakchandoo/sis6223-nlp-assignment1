                    The Security Council,
                    Reaffirming its resolutions 1265 (1999), 1325 (2000), 1368 (2001), 1373 (2001),

               (2019), 2544 (2020), 2597 (2021) and its relevant presidential statements,

               United Nations,
                     Recalling that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as
               Da’esh) constitutes a global threat to international peace and security through its
               terrorist acts, its violent extremist ideology, its continued gross, systematic and
               widespread attacks directed against civilians, its violations of internatio nal
               humanitarian law and abuses of human rights, particularly those committed against
               women and children, and including those motivated by religious or ethnic grounds,
               and its recruitment and training of foreign terrorist fighters whose threat affects all
               regions and Member States,
                     Condemning the commission of acts by ISIL (Da’esh) involving murder,
               kidnapping, hostage-taking, suicide bombings, enslavement, sale into or otherwise
               forced marriage, trafficking in persons, rape, sexual slavery and other form s of sexual
               violence, recruitment and use of children, attacks on critical infrastructure, as well as
               its destruction of cultural heritage, including archaeological sites, and trafficking of
               cultural property,
                     Recognizing that the commission of such acts which may amount to war crimes,
               crimes against humanity or genocide, is part of the ideology and strategic objectives
               of ISIL (Da’esh), and used by ISIL (Da’esh) as a tactic of terrorism, and that holding
               ISIL (Da’esh) members accountable, particularly those who bear the greatest
               responsibility, including in terms of leadership, which can include regional or
               mid-level commanders, and the ordering and commission of crimes, will further
               expose this, and could assist in countering terrorism and violent extrem ism which can
               be conducive to terrorism, including by stemming financing and the continued flow
               of international recruits to the terrorist group ISIL (Da’esh),
