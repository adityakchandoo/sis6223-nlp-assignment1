                 considerations related to the financing of African Union peace support operations
                 authorized by the Security Council as requested in the statement by the President of
                 the Security Council on 31 August 2022, and noting the African Union Consensus
                 Paper on Predictable, Adequate and Sustainable Financing for African Union Peace
                 and Security Activities adopted by the 36th ordinary session of the Assembly of the
                 African Union held on 18–19 February 2023,
                       Noting the ongoing efforts of the African Union and its sub-regional
                 organisations to strengthen the implementation of the framework of the African Peace
                 and Security Architecture to undertake peace support operations on the continent,
                 including peace enforcement, consistent with the relevant provisions of Chapter VIII
                 of the Charter of the United Nations, and reaffirming, in this context, the significant
                 contributions being made by African Union peace support operations in maintaining
                 regional and continental peace, in particular the comparative advantage, as “first
                 responders” with the political will in undertaking peace support operations, under the
                 effective and direct command and control of the African Union,
                       Recognising the changing nature of conflicts in Africa and the need to be able
                 to draw on a range of international responses and their complementarity to fit the
                 specific complex operating environments and evolving threats, including in some
                 environments the increasing use of asymmetric tactics by non-state armed groups,
                 terrorists and violent extremists, as well as the sophistication of violent extremism
                 conducive to terrorism, the deliberate targeting of peacekeepers, and the expanding
                 influence of transnational organised crime,
                       Reaffirming that States bear the primary responsibility for the prevention of
                 conflict and protection of civilians within their territories and further recognizing the
                 role that regional and subregional organizations play in this regard and that national
                 ownership and regional and subregional support is key to establishing sustainable
                 peace, and noting the important role of relevant stakeholders in preventing conflicts,
                 including countering violent extremism conducive to terrorism,
                       Noting the need to enhance and align the United Nations and African Union
                 efforts to support the national initiatives to address the security challenges of the
                 continent including through comprehensive solutions that respond to the root causes
                 and drivers of conflicts in Africa and underscoring the importance of the primacy of
                 politics and the need for coherent political strategies for African Union-led Peace
                 Support Operations authorised by the Security Council, and affirming that lasting
                 peace is not achieved nor sustained by military and technical engagements alone, but
                 through political solutions, and convinced that they should guide the design and
                 deployment of African Union-led Peace Support Operations,
                      Further underscoring the importance of a holistic approach to peace operations
                 deployed in Africa and underlying the centrality of the United Nations in
                 Peacekeeping Operations and the need to ensure coherence, coordination and
                 complementarity between African Union-led Peace Support Operations and United
                 Nations Peace Operations, in accordance with their respective mandates and avoid
                 duplication of efforts,
                       Noting also the progress made by the United Nations and the African Union in
                 the joint planning and management of African Union-led Peace Support Operations,
                 including in the areas of consultative evaluation, analysis, and assessment of African
                 Union missions as well as the conduct of joint assessments and technical missions,
                       Welcoming the substantial progress made by the African Union since 2017 to
                 strengthen its international humanitarian law, human rights and conduct and
                 discipline compliance frameworks with the support of the United Nations and partners
                 including the European Union and the African Union’s commitment to plan and

           conduct its peace support operations in accordance with international human rights
           law and international humanitarian law, regional human rights instruments and
           applicable standards of conduct and discipline and underscoring the importance of a
           progressive implementation and evolution of the African Union’s adopted
           frameworks and its compliance in a manner that ensures the Security Council’s
           oversight of operations that it may authorize,
                 Also bearing in mind that promoting standards of compliance with international
           law, including, international humanitarian law and international human rights law,
           and conduct and discipline is an iterative and ongoing process requiring sustained
           support and dedicated resources including from partners,
                 Recognising the revitalisation of the African Union Peace Fund and the
           improvement of the Financial Rules and Regulations to support prudent management
           of resources and improved accountability, and welcoming the ambition to support
           African Union peace and security activities from the Fund, including Peace Support
           Operations,
                 Noting the significant contributions being made by the African Union,
           sub-regional organisations and its Member States, with the support of the United
           Nations and international partners, towards the maintenance of international peace
           and security on the continent and recognising the adverse impact that ad hoc,
           inadequate and unpredictable financing arrangements have had on African Union -led
           Peace Support Operations authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VIII of
           the Charter, and underlining the need to enhance the adequacy, predictability and
           sustainability of financing for African Union-led Peace Support Operations
           authorised by the Security Council and under the Security Council’s authority
           consistent with Chapter VIII of the UN Charter,
                 Recognising the various financing models presented by the Secretary-General
           in his report S/2017/454 on options for authorization and support for African Union
           peace support operations through which United Nations assessed contributions could
           be used to support African Union-led Peace Support Operations on a case-by-case
           basis, and stressing that any financing model to be used should be adequate,
           predictable and sustainable,
                 Acknowledging the existing efforts of the African Union and its Member States
           to share the burden of African Union-led Peace Support Operations authorised by the
           Security Council together with financing from United Nations assessed contributions,
           and determined to address the financing challenges identified with Africa Union-led
           Peace Support Operations and strengthen the strategic partnership between the United

           maintenance of international peace and security, calling for the use of United Nations
           assessed contributions based on established parameters of the United Nations
           standards and building on existing practices to ensure access to adequate, predictable,
           and sustainable financing of African Union-led Peace Support Operations,
                 1.   Reaffirms its determination to take effective steps to further enhance the

           African Union-led Peace Support Operations requiring logistical, financial and other
           support through the United Nations assessed contributions, the Security Council will
