               are consistent with the basic principles, reiterating that the Security Council expects

               efforts to restore State authority in all parts of the country,
                    Emphasizing that any sustainable solution to the crisis in the CAR should be
               CAR-owned, including the political process, and should prioritise reconciliation of
               the Central African people, through an inclusive process that involves men and
               women of all social, economic, political, religious and ethnic backgrounds, including
               those displaced by the crisis,
                     Recalling the signing of the Political Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in

                     37. Requests the Secretary-General to deploy and allocate personnel and
               expertise within MINUSCA to reflect the priorities identified by paragraph 34 to
               paragraph 36 of this resolution, and to continuously adjust this deployment according
               to the progresses made in the implementation of this mandate;
                     38. Recalls the decision taken by the Security Council in its resolution 2566
               to increase the authorized size of MINUSCA’s military component by 2,750 and to
               increase the authorized size of MINUSCA’s police component by 940, welcomes the
               deployment of some of the reinforcement thus decided, stresses the need for the rest
               of these reinforcements to be deployed as quickly as possible, especially quick
               reaction forces, and sequenced through a phased approach, and recalls the importance
               of cooperation between MINUSCA and the CAR authorities in line with its mandate;
                    39. Reiterates its concern at the continuing lack of key capabilities for
               MINUSCA and the need to fill gaps, as well as the importance of current and future
               troop and police contributing countries (T/PCCs) providing troops and police with
               adequate capabilities, equipment and predeployment training, including with regards
               to explosive ordnance threat mitigation, in order to enhance the capacity of
               MINUSCA to operate effectively in an increasingly complex security environment;
                     40. Recognizes that the effective implementation of peacekeeping mandates is
               the responsibility of all stakeholders and is contingent upon several critical factors,
               including well-defined, realistic, and achievable mandates, political will, leadership,
               performance and accountability at all levels, adequate resources, policy, planning, and
               operational guidelines, and training and equipment, urges Member States to provide
               troops and police that have adequate capabilities and mindset, including regarding
               language skills, pre-deployment and, where appropriate, in situ training, and
               equipment, including enablers, specific to the operating environment, requests troop
               and police contributing countries to implement relevant provisions of resolution 2538
               (2020) notes the potential adverse effects on mandate implementation of national
               caveats which have not been declared and accepted by the Secretary-General prior to
               deployment, highlights that lack of effective command and control, refusal to obey
               orders, failure to respond to attacks on civilians, declining to participate in or
               undertake patrols may adversely affect the shared responsibility for effective mandate
               implementation, and calls on Members State to declare all national caveats, prior to
               the contingent deployment, provide troops and police with the minimum of declared
               caveats, and to fully and effectively implement the provisions of the Memoranda of
               Understanding (MoU) signed with the United Nations;
                     41. Requests the Secretary-General, Member States, and the CAR authorities
               to continue to take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety, security and freedom
               of movement of MINUSCA’s personnel with unhindered and immediate access
               throughout the CAR, in line with resolution 2518 (2020), notes with concern the grave
               risks violations of the Status of Forces Agreement can present to the safety and
               security of United Nations personnel serving in peacekeeping operations, a nd
               requests the Secretary-General to implement the provisions of resolution 2589 (2021)
