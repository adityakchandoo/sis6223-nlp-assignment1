               Peace (the Final Agreement), urging the parties, with the support of relevant state
               institutions and security forces, as well as civil society including youth , to work
               together to continue building upon this progress and address ongoing challenges, in
               particular the continued violence in conflict-affected areas, through comprehensive

               participation, its ethnic and gender provisions, and countering illicit drugs including
               through crop substitution programmes, and recalling the disproportionate impact of

               section 6.3.3 of the Final Agreement, and recalling the positive role played by the
               Verification Mission in that regard, emphasising the efforts of the UN Verification
               Mission in Colombia to continue to integrate a gender perspective as a cross -cutting
               issue into its planning, verification and reporting, and recognising the importance of
               other perspectives including development, and ensuring adequate gender expertise as
               appropriate,

               will have the overall aim of realising the rights of victims and consolidating peace,
               and will need to have the greatest restorative and reparative function in relation to the
               harm caused,
                     Recognising the contribution the Verification Mission could make to buildin g
               confidence in the Comprehensive System for Truth, Justice, Reparation and
               Non-Repetition established under the Final Agreement, which is integral to the
               success of the peace process and the fulfilment of the rights of the victims of the
               conflict,
                     Recalling its resolution 2673 (2023) which expanded the mandate of the

               the Final Agreement,
                     Recalling also its resolution 2694 (2023) which expanded the mandate of the
               Verification Mission to monitor and verify the implementation of the ceasefire as

               ceasefire including appropriate verification protocols has been reached, and taking
               into account an update from the Secretary-General on the progress of implementation
               of resolution 2694 (2023),
