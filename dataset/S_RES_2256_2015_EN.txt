               their sentences, and emphasizing the importance of the successful relocation of such
               persons,

               Rule 11 bis of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the ICTR, and emphasizing
               the importance of continuing monitoring progress in referred cases, as well as the
               goal of achieving the completion of all referred cases at the earliest possible time,
                    Further noting that the initial period of the operation of the Mechanism, as set
               out by resolution 1966 (2010), ends on 30 June 2016, and that the Mechanism shall
               continue to operate for subsequent periods of two years following a review by the
               Council of the progress of its work, unless the Council decides otherwise,
                     Recalling its review of the progress of the work of the Mechanis m, including
               in completing its functions, pursuant to paragraph 17 of resolution 1966 (2010) and

               the ICTR set for 31 December 2015;
                     2.    Acknowledges the substantial contribution of the ICTR to the process of
               national reconciliation and the restoration of peace and security, and to the fight
               against impunity and the development of international criminal justice, especially in
               relation to the crime of genocide;
                     3.    Reiterates its request to the ICTY to complete its work and facilitate the
               closure of the Tribunal as expeditiously as possible with the aim of completing the
               transition to the Mechanism, and expresses its continued concern over repeated
               delays in the conclusion of the Tribunal’s work, in light of resolution 1966 (2010),

                10. Renews its call on the ICTY, in light of resolution 1966 (2010), to

S/RES/2256 (2015)


               acquitted persons and convicted persons who have completed serving their
               sentences;
                     13. Urges all States, especially States where fugitives are suspected to be at
               large, to intensify their cooperation with and render all necessary assistance to the
               Mechanism, in particular to achieve the arrest and surrender of all remaining
               fugitives indicted by the ICTR as soon as possible;
                    14. Urges the DRC to transfer Ladislas Ntaganzwa for trial without delay or

                    15. Urges the Mechanism to continue monitoring the cases of Laurent
               Bucyibaruta, Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, Jean Uwinkindi and Bernard Munyagishari,
               which were referred to national jurisdictions;
                     16. Emphasizes that, in view of the substantially reduced nature of the
               residual functions, the Mechanism was established to be a small, temporary and
               efficient structure, whose functions and size will diminish over time, with a sma ll
               number of staff commensurate with its reduced functions, and, recognizing in this
               regard the full commitment to these elements expressed by the Mechanism, urges
               the Mechanism to continue to be guided in its activities by these elements;
                     17. Welcomes the report (S/2015/896) and supplementary information
               submitted by the Mechanism to the Council pursuant to its Presidential Statement
               (S/PRST/2015/21) for the purposes of the review of the progress of the work of the
               Mechanism, including in completing its functions, as required by paragraph 17 of
               resolution 1966 of 22 December 2010;
                     18. Takes note of the work of the Mechanism to date, in particular
               development of a legal and regulatory framework, procedures, and working
               practices consistent with the Statute of the Mechanism and drawing on lessons
               learned from and best practices of the ICTY and ICTR and of other tribunals,
               including its implementation of the double-hatting of personnel, use of rosters to
               ensure judges and staff are utilized only when required, enabling judges and staff to
               work remotely to the maximum extent possible, and minimizing the need for full
               bench participation in pre-trial and pre-appeal hearing work, in order to produce
               substantial reductions in the costs of judicial activities compared to those of the
               ICTY and ICTR, and commends the Mechanism for its efforts to produce such
               reductions;
                     19. Notes further the views and recommendations made with regard to the
               Mechanism’s work by the Council’s Informal Working Group on International
               Tribunals, as reflected in this resolution, and requests the Mechanism to take into
               account those views and implement the recommendations, and to continue to take
               steps, such as those referred to in paragraph 18, to further enhance efficiency and
               effective and transparent management, in particular full implemen tation of the
               outstanding recommendations of the OIOS; production of more focused projections
               of completion timelines and disciplined adherence thereto, including by making the
               best use of the diverse approaches of common law and civil law systems;
               enhancement of the geographic diversity and gender balance of staff, while ensuring
               continued professional expertise; implementation of a human resources policy
               consistent with its temporary mandate; and further reduction of costs, including
               through, but not limited to, flexible staff engagement;




4/5                                                                                                    15-22712

                                                                                              S/RES/2256 (2015)


                 20. Further requests the Mechanism to include in its six-monthly reports to
           the Council information on progress achieved in implementing this resolution, as
           well as detailed information on the staffing of the Mechanism, respective workload
           and related costs with breakdown by division and detailed projections of the
           duration of residual functions based on available data;
                21. Further notes the conclusion of the Council’s review of the progress of
           the work of the Mechanism, including in completing its functions, during its initial
           period, pursuant to resolution 1966 (2010);
                22. Recalls, with a view to strengthening independent oversight of the
           Mechanism, that, as set out in its Presidential Statement of 16 November 2015
           (S/PRST/2015/21), future reviews carried out pursuant to paragraph 17 of resolution
           1966 (2010) shall include evaluation reports sought from the OIOS with respect to
           the methods and work of the Mechanism;
                 23. Encourages the Mechanism and the Government of Rwanda to
           collaborate on matters related to the legacy of the ICTR with respect to
           reconciliation and justice in Rwanda, including in respect of access to archives;
                24.   Decides to remain seized of the matter.
