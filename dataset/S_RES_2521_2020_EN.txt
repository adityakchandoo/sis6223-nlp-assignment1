               statements on the situation in South Sudan,
                     Welcoming encouraging developments in South Sudan’s peace process,
               including the beginning of the formation of a Revitalized Transitional Government of
               National Unity (RTGNU), recognizing that this represents a significant step towards
               sustainable peace by the parties to the Revitalized Agreement, and further welcoming
               the spirit of compromise and political will demonstrated by the parties in order to
               create the conditions necessary to advance the peace process,
                     Expressing appreciation for the leadership of the Intergovernmental Authority
               on Development (IGAD) in advancing the peace process in South Sudan, underlining
               that the 2018 “Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the
               Republic of South Sudan” (the Revitalised Agreement) is an important step forward
               in the peace process that provides a window of opportunity to achieve sustainable
               peace and stability in South Sudan, commending the ongoing mediation by the
               Community of Sant’Egidio to foster political dialogue between signatories and
               non-signatories of the Revitalised Agreement, and calling on South Sudanese parties
               to demonstrate the political will to peacefully resolve the conflict,
                    Recognizing the reduction in political violence since the signing of the
               Revitalised Agreement and that the permanent ceasefire was upheld in most parts of
               the country, and further recognizing the efforts of the RTGNU in addressing the
               COVID-19 pandemic,
                     Reiterating its concern regarding the political, security, economic, and
               humanitarian situation in South Sudan, and emphasizing that there can be no military
               solution to the conflict,
                     Strongly condemning past and ongoing human rights violations and abuses and
               violations of international humanitarian law, further condemning harassment and
               targeting of civil society, humanitarian personnel and journalists, emphasizing that
               those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and violations and
               abuses of human rights must be held accountable, and that the RTGNU bears the
               primary responsibility to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic
               cleansing, and crimes against humanity, and in this regard, urging the RTGNU to
