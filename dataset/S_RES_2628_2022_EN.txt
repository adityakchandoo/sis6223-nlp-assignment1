               system,
                    Expressing grave concern at the continued presence in Somalia of affiliates
               linked to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL also known as Da’esh),
                     Recognising that the nature of the threat posed by Al-Shabaab has evolved, and
               that international support to Somalia must adapt accordingly to consolidate the
               security gains achieved to date and ensure continued progress towards a more stable,
               secure and peaceful Somalia,
                     Recalling the need for a reconfigured African Union mission in Somalia, which
               is focussed on enabling and supporting Somalia to take primary responsibility for its
               security, and expressing appreciation for Somalia and the African Union’s joint effort
               to update AMISOM’s Concept of Operations (CONOPS) in line with the STP and in
               close cooperation with the United Nations and international partners, to help inform
               decisions about the size and shape of the future mission, including its logistical
               requirements,
                     Noting with appreciation the proposal submitted to the Security Council on
               7 March 2022 by the Secretary-General, and produced jointly with the African Union,

               peace and security in Somalia, emphasising that the protection of civilians is critical
               to build sustainable peace, and reiterating the need to pursue a holistic approach that

           governance, peace and reconciliation,
                 Recognising the complementary work of the United Nations Panel of Experts
           for Somalia and the role of sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council,

               agreements, and urges the FGS and FMS to ensure any disputes over implementation
               of these agreements are resolved peaceably so the electoral process can be completed
               without further delay, and underscores that completing the electoral process, and
               achieving a peaceful transition of power, will help to progress national priorities and

               make in this regard and calls on Somalia to provide a safe environment for civil
               society organisations to work freely and protect them from threats and reprisals;
                     4.   Reiterates its objective of enabling Somalia to take full responsibility for
               its own security, including through assuming the leading role in countering and
               addressing the threat posed by Al-Shabaab, including through the conduct of military
               operations to degrade Al-Shabaab’s capabilities, and strongly urges Somalia to use
               the opportunity and support provided by the international community to prioritise the
               implementation of the STP and NSA and the generation of accountable, affordable

                     5.    Calls on the Somali authorities to ensure the delivery of the STP and NSA

                     6.   Underscores the primary responsibility for protecting civilians of the
               Somali authorities, and further underscores the importance of protecting civilians in
               accordance with relevant provisions of international human rights law and

                     7.    Calls on the Somali authorities, with the coordinated support of the
               international community, to assume progressively greater responsibility for national

           CONOPs;
                 9.    Calls on the Somali authorities to enhance civilian oversight and

           sustainment support, reiterates the critical role police play in securing and holding
           territory and emphasises that a professional and capable police force, able to
           contribute to providing security for civilian populations, is necessary for Somalia to
           fully implement the STP and NSA, and encourages inclusive and representative
           Somali security and police force recruitment from all sections of Somali society;
                 11. Calls on Somalia to ensure all security and police forces fully respect
           international human rights law and international humanitarian law and to ensure that
           those responsible for violations and abuses of human rights and violations of
           international humanitarian law are held accountable, further calls on the United
           Nations, African Union and other international partners to support the Somali
           authorities with this as appropriate and requests that ATMIS share the experience and
           lessons-learnt from the operation of the Civilian Casualty Tracking Analysis and
           Response Cell (CCTARC) with national authorities, including with a view to
           supporting the development of Somali civilian casualty monitoring, mitigation, and

                 12. Calls on the Somali authorities, in coordination with ATMIS, international

           the security situation in each location during transition of security responsibilities
           from ATMIS to Somalia, and emphasises that planning, and decision-making should
           be guided by a comprehensive assessment of the threat to civilians, and that proactive
           measures to mitigate risks should be taken, including by establishing an appropriately
           sized, qualified and accountable Somali security and police force presence to ensure
           continued security and protection before, during and after military action;
                 14. Recalls resolutions 1612 (2005) and subsequent resolutions on Children
           and Armed Conflict and expresses its grave concern over reports of killing, maiming,
           rape and other forms of sexual violence used against children in armed conflict as

                     (d) cease detentions of all children on national security charges where this is
               in violation of applicable international law and instead to treat children primarily as
               victims, consistent with Somalia’s obligations under the United Nations Conventi on
               on the Rights of the Child; and
