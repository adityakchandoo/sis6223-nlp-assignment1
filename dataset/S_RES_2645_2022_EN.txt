                     Welcoming the agreement of the Heads of Government of CARICOM for a high
               level political mission to Haiti and its readiness to assist,
                    Stressing the primary responsibility of the Government of Haiti to address
               longstanding drivers of instability and inequality, and to engage with other
               stakeholders, including civil society, youth, and the private sector, and the ful l, equal,
