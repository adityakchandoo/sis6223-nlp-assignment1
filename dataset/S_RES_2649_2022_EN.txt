               Resolution 2649 (2022)
               Adopted by the Security Council at its 9119th meeting, on
               30 August 2022

                    The Security Council,
                    Recalling all its previous resolutions, statements of its President and press
               statements on the situation in Mali,
                     Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity and territorial
               integrity of Mali, emphasizing that the Malian authorities have primary responsibility
               for the provision of stability and security throughout the territory of Mali, and
               underscoring the importance of achieving national ownership of peace- and securityrelated initiatives,
                     Recalling the provisions of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali
               (“the Agreement”) calling upon the Security Council to give its full support to the
               Agreement, to closely monitor its implementation and, if necessary, to take measures
               against anyone hindering the implementation of the commitments contained therein
               or the realization of its objectives,
                     Reiterating that the United Nations, the African Union, the Economic
               Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and other international partners
               remain firmly committed to the implementation of the Agreement as a means to
               achieve long-term peace and stability in Mali, welcoming the holding in Bamako from
               1 to 5 August 2022 of a high-level decision-making meeting on the implementation
               of the Agreement and decisions made at that meeting, but stressing the need for action
               on these decisions, expressing regret that the Comité de suivi de l’Accord (CSA) has
               not met since October 2021, further expressing a significant impatience with parties
               over the persistent delays in the implementation of the overall Agreement, which
               contribute to a political and security vacuum jeopardizing the stability and
               development of Mali, stressing the need for increased ownership and prioritization in
               the implementation of the Agreement, and further stressing the importance of the full,
               equal and meaningful participation of women in all the mechanisms established by
               the Agreement to support and monitor its implementation,
                     Commending the role played by Algeria and other members of the international
               mediation team to assist the Malian parties to implement the Agreement, emphasizing
               the need for increased engagement by the members of the international mediation
               team for the implementation of the Agreement, and further underlining the central
               role the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Mali should continue to

               progress in its implementation, and recalling its readiness to respond with measures
               pursuant to resolution 2374 (2017) should the parties engage in hostilities in violation
               of the Agreement, take actions that obstruct, or that obstruct by prolonged delay, or

               the individuals designated cease all illicit activities, including those listed in the
               statement of case, while stressing that the Security Council has not yet seen sufficient
               progress to merit such consideration,
