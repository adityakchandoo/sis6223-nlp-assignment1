               United Nations                                                                  S/RES/2714 (2023)

                                                                                1 December 2023




               Resolution 2714 (2023)

               1 December 2023

                       The Security Council,
                     Recalling all its previous resolutions and statements of its President on the
               situation in Somalia,
                    Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political
               independence and unity of Somalia,
                    Highlighting its decision in this resolution to fully lift the arms embargo on the
               Federal Republic of Somalia established under resolution 733 (1992) as amended,
                   Emphasising, for the avoidance of doubt, that there is no arms embargo on the
               Government of the Federal Republic of Somalia (GFRS),
                       Emphasising that effective weapons and ammunition management in Somalia
               will:
                    a.    reduce the ability of Al-Shabaab, and other actors intent on undermining
               peace and security in Somalia and the region, to obtain weapons and ammunition,
                    b.   improve the ability of the GFRS and Somalia’s Federal Member States and
               regional governments to analyse and understand the origins of weapons and
               ammunition captured from Al-Shabaab or other actors, and,
                    c.   reduce the threat to peace and security posed by terrorists, in Somalia and
               neighbouring states,
                    Welcoming the technical assessments of the weapons and ammunition
               management capability of Somalia (S/2022/698 and S/2023/676), and the benchmarks
               proposed following the technical assessment, commending Somalia for the progress
               made, especially with regards to weapons management, and urging continued
               progress against the indicators,
                     Underlining the responsibility of the GFRS to ensure the safe and effective
               management, storage and security of their stockpiles of weapons, ammunition and
               other military equipment and their distribution, urging the GFRS to continue to codify
               and implement weapons and ammunition management policies and regulations,
               including continued development of an accountable weapons distribution and tracing
               system for all Somali security and police institutions,
