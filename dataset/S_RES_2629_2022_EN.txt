               29 April 2022

                    The Security Council,
                    Recalling its resolution 1970 (2011) and all its subsequent resolutions on Libya,
               including resolutions 2259 (2015), 2510 (2020), 2542 (2020) and 2570 (2021),
                     Reaffirming its strong commitment to a Libyan-led and Libyan-owned political
               process, facilitated by the United Nations, to create a path to hold free, fair and
               inclusive national Presidential and Parliamentary elections in Libya as soon as
               possible, in this regard, expressing support for the ongoing facilitation of intra-Libyan
               consultations to create the conditions and circumstances for elections on a
               constitutional and legal basis, and recalling the timeline elaborated in the Libyan
               Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) roadmap and the role of all relevant institutio ns in
               delivering elections,
                    Recalling its determination in its resolution 2213 (2015) that the situation in
               Libya continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security,

               carry out its mandate, as set out in resolution 2542 (2020) and paragraph 16 of
               resolution 2570 (2021);
                    2.    Takes note of the Independent Strategic Review of UNSMIL (S/2021/716),
               requests the Mission to implement its recommendations, decides that UNSMIL should
               be led by a Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG), in Tripoli,
               supported by two Deputy Special Representatives of the Secretary -General, and calls
               upon the Secretary-General to appoint a SRSG promptly;
                     3.   Requests that, in the implementation of the recommendations of the
               Strategic Review, UNSMIL explores all avenues to increase efficiency and redeploy
               existing resources, including through prioritisation and the reconfiguration of tasks
               and resources, as needed and where appropriate;
                     4.   Calls upon all parties to refrain from any actions that could undermine the
               political process or the 23 October 2020 ceasefire in Libya, which should be
               implemented in full, and recalls that the measures set out in resolution 1970 (2011),
               as modified by subsequent resolutions, shall apply to individuals and entities
               determined by the United Nations Sanctions Committee to be engaging in or
