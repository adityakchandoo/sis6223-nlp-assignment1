               31 May 2022

                    The Security Council,
                     Recalling its previous resolutions 2018 (2011) and 2039 (2012), and its
               presidential statement S/PRST/2016/4, on piracy and armed robbery at sea in the Gulf
               of Guinea, as well as its presidential statement S/PRST/2021/15 on maritime security,
                     Expressing its deep concern about the grave and persistent threat that piracy,
               armed robbery and transnational organized crime at sea in the Gulf of Guinea pose to
               international navigation, security, and sustainable development of States in the
               region, including the effect on littoral countries, their hinterland areas and landlocked
               countries,
                     Reaffirming that international law, as reflected in the United Nations
               Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) of 10 December 1982, sets out the legal
               framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out,
               including countering piracy and armed robbery at sea, and the provisions of this
               resolution apply only with respect to the situation in the Gulf of Guinea,

               the Safety of Maritime Navigation, the 1988 Protocol of the Suppression of Unlawful
               Acts Against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf, and
               their 2005 Protocols, which broadly establish the framework for collaboration
               between States Parties,
                    Affirming its respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the States of
               the Gulf of Guinea and their neighbours, and reiterating that States in the region have
               a leadership role to play in countering the threat and meaningfully addressing the
               underlying causes of piracy and armed robbery at sea in the Gulf of Guinea, in close
               cooperation with the African Union (AU), the Economic Community of Central
               African States (ECCAS), the Economic Community of West African States
               (ECOWAS), the Gulf of Guinea Commission (GGC), other organizations in the
               region, and their partners,
                     Emphasizing that regional peace and stability, the strengthening of democracy,
               State institutions, national capacity-building, addressing underlying causes of piracy
               and armed robbery at sea, sustainable development, including opportunities for
               women and youth, respect for human rights, and the rule of law and good governance,

               durable eradication of piracy and armed robbery at sea in the Gulf of Guinea,
               especially following the multifaceted repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic,
                     Expressing its concern over the threat that piracy and armed robbery at sea pose
               to the safety of seafarers, including through their being taken as hostages, as well as
               over the violence employed by pirates and persons involved in piracy and armed
               robbery at sea in the Gulf of Guinea, and over the adverse humanitarian impact on
               the seafarers and their family members,
                     Further expressing its concern about the destabilizing and negative impact on
               West and Central Africa and neighbouring States of transnational organized crime, oil
               and cargo theft, illicit trafficking and diversion of arms, drug trafficking, human
               trafficking, illegal trade and smuggling, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing,
               and piracy and armed robbery at sea, and noting the complex relationship between
               these issues,
                     Condemning that pirate networks continue to rely on kidnapping and hostagetaking, in the context of weak national capacities, to help generate funding to purchase
               weapons, gain recruits, and continue their operational activities, thereby jeopardizing
               the safety and security of seafarers and restricting the flow of commerce,
                     Expressing serious concern over the cost of piracy to States in the region
               through economic impacts on trade, investments, development, and growth, noting
               the study supported by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) on
               “Pirates of the Gulf of Guinea, a cost analysis for the coastal states” and its findings
               of significant direct, indirect and opportunity costs to the region, encouraging the
               region, with the support of partners, to address these findings, their underlying causes,
               and to strengthen the measures to counter piracy, and in this regard welcoming the
               interest given to this issue by the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC),
                    Taking into account relevant regional arrangements, such as the African Charter
               on Maritime Security, Safety and Development in Africa, the Africa Maritime

               Interregional Coordination Centre (ICC), the Abidjan Interregional Maritime Security
               Institute, the Regional Maritime Safety and Security Centres, and the creation of zonal
               centres under the auspices of the Multinational Maritime Coordination Centres,
                    Further welcoming existing national initiatives by States in the region to counter
               piracy and armed robbery at sea in the Gulf of Guinea, including existing and new

           of Conduct with a view to eradicating illegal activities off the coast of West and
           Central Africa,
                Underlining the importance of determining the existence of any possible or
           potential links between piracy and armed robbery at sea and terrorist groups in West
           and Central Africa and the Sahel region,
               1.     Strongly condemns piracy and armed robbery at sea, including acts of
           murder, kidnapping and hostage-taking, in the Gulf of Guinea;
                2.     Stresses the primary responsibility of the States of the Gulf of Guinea to
